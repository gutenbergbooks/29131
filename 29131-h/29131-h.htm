<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>DEEP CA&Ntilde;ON</h3>
</div>
<p>The hunter was riding leisurely up the steep mountain
side above Dry Mesa. On such an ascent
most city men would have preferred to climb afoot.
But there was a month&#8217;s layer of tan on the hunter&#8217;s
handsome, supercilious face. He balanced himself
lightly on his flat English saddle, and permitted the
wiry little cow pony to pick the best path over the
ledges and up the stiff slopes between the scattered
pines.</p>
<p>In keeping with his saddle, the hunter wore English
riding breeches and leggins. Otherwise he was
dressed as a Texas cowboy of the past generation.
His sombrero was almost Mexican in its size and ornateness.
But his rifle was of the latest American
pattern, and in place of the conventional Colt&#8217;s he carried
an automatic pistol. As his horse patiently clambered
with him up towards the top of the escarpment
the man gazed indolently about between half-closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
eyelids and inhaled the smoke from an unbroken
&#8220;chain&#8221; of gilt-tipped cigarettes.</p>
<p>The pony scrambled up the last ledges and came to
a halt on the rim of High Mesa. It had been a long,
hard climb. Tough as he was and mountain bred, the
beast&#8217;s rough coat was lathered with sweat and his
flanks were heaving. The hunter&#8217;s gaze roamed carelessly
over the hilly pine-clad plateau of the upper
mesa, while he took a nip of brandy from a silver-cased
flask and washed it down with a drink of the
tepid water in his canteen.</p>
<p>Having refreshed himself, he touched a patent
lighter to another cigarette, chose a direction at random,
and spurred his pony into a canter. The beast
held to the pace until the ascent of a low but steep
ridge brought him down to a walk. With the change
of gait the hunter paused in the act of lighting a fresh
cigarette, to gaze up at the sapphire sky. The air
was reverberating with a muffled sound like distant
thunder. Yet the crystal-clear dome above him
showed no trace of a cloud all across from the magnificent
snowy ranges on the east and north to the
sparsely wooded mountains and sage-gray mesas to the
south and west.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be thunder,&#8221; he murmured&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;no sign of a
storm. Must be a stream. Ah! cool, fresh water!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sharp-roweled spurs goaded the pony up over
the round of the ridge as fast as he could scramble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
At the top he broke into a lope and raced headlong
down the other side of the ridge through the tall
brush. The reverberating sound of water was clearer
but still muffled and distant.</p>
<p>The rider let his reins hang slack and recklessly dug
in his spurs. The pony leaped ahead with still greater
speed and burst out of the brush on to a narrow open
slope that led down to the brink of a ca&ntilde;on. The
hunter saw first the precipice on the far side of the
yawning chasm&ndash;&ndash;then the near edge, seemingly, to
his startled gaze, right under his horse&#8217;s forefeet. He
was dashing straight at the frightful abyss.</p>
<p>A yell of terror burst from his lips, and he sought
to fling himself backwards and sideways out of the
saddle. His instinctive purpose was to fall to the
ground and clutch the grass tufts. But in the same
moment that he tried to throw himself off, the nimble
pony swerved to the left so abruptly that the man&#8217;s
effort served only to keep himself balanced on the saddle.
Had he remained erect or flung himself to the
other side he must have been hurled off and down over
the precipice.</p>
<p>Nor was the danger far from past. Carried on
down the slope by the momentum of their headlong
rush, the plunging pony &#8220;skidded&#8221; to the very brink
of the precipice. Though the man shrank down and
sought to avert his face, he caught a glimpse of the
black depths below them as, snorting with fear, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
pony wrenched himself around on the rim shelf of
the edge.</p>
<p>For an instant&ndash;&ndash;an instant that was an age of sickening
suspense to his rider&ndash;&ndash;the pony toppled. But
before the man could shriek out his horror, the agile
beast had recovered his balance and was scrambling
around, away from the edge. He plunged a few yards
up the slope, and stopped, wheezing and blowing.</p>
<p>The man flung the reins over the pony&#8217;s head and
slipped to the ground. For a minute or longer he
lay outstretched, limp and white-faced. When he
looked up, the pony was stolidly cropping a tuft of
grass. Beasts are not often troubled with imagination.
The hunter remembered his brandy flask.
After two long pulls at its contents, the vivid coloring
began to return to his cheeks.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet and walked down to a ledge on
the brink of the precipice with an air of bravado. But
when he looked over into the chasm, he quickly shrank
back and crouched on his hands and knees. Before
again peering over he stretched himself out flat on the
level ledge and grasped an out-jutting point of rock.</p>
<p>Beneath his dizzy eyes the precipitous sides of the
ca&ntilde;on dropped away seemingly into the very bowels
of the earth,&ndash;&ndash;far down in sheer unbroken walls of
black rock for hundreds and thousands of feet. He
flattened closer to the rock on which he lay, and sought
to pierce with his gaze the blue-black shadows of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
stupendous rift. Every nerve in his body tingled; his
ankles ached with the exquisite pain of that overpowering
sight.</p>
<p>The chasm was so narrow and its depth so great
that only in one place did the noonday sun strike down
through its gloomy abyss to the bottom. At that
single spot he could distinguish the foam and flash of
the rushing waters, but elsewhere his only evidence of
the sunken torrent beneath him was the ceaseless reverberations
that came rolling up out of the depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;To think I came so
near&ndash;&ndash;!... Must be what they call Deep Ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He crept away from the brink. As he rose to his
feet his trembling fingers automatically placed a cigarette
between his lips and applied the patent lighter.
Soothed by the narcotic, he stood gazing across at the
far side of the ca&ntilde;on while he sucked in and slowly
exhaled the smoke. With the last puff he touched a
fresh cigarette to the butt of the first, thrust it between
his lips, and snipped the cork stub over the edge into
the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are&ndash;&ndash;take that!&#8221; he mocked the abyss.</p>
<p>As he turned away he drew out an extremely thin
gold watch. The position of the hour hand brought
a petulant frown to his white forehead. He hastened
to mount his pony. Short as had been the rest, the
wiry little animal had regained his wind and strength.
Stung by the spurs, he plunged up the side of the ridge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
and loped off along its level top, parallel with the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>The hunter drew his rifle from its saddle sheath
and began to scrutinize the country before him in
search of game. A pair of weather-beaten antlers so
excited him that he even forgot to maintain his chain
of cigarettes. His dark eyes shone bright and eager
and his full red lips grew tense in resolute lines that
completely altered the previous laxity of his expression.</p>
<p>He had covered nearly a mile when he was rewarded
for his alertness by a glimpse of a large animal
in the chaparral thicket before him. He drew rein to
test the wind in approved book hunter fashion. There
was not a breath of air stirring. The mesa lay basking
in the dry, hot stillness of the July afternoon. He
set the safety catch of his rifle, ready for instant firing,
stretched himself flat on his pony&#8217;s neck, and started on.</p>
<p>The animal in the thicket moved slowly to the right,
as if grazing. At frequent intervals the hunter caught
glimpses of its roan side, but could not see its head or
the outline of its body. At seventy-five yards, fearful
that his game might take fright and bolt, he turned
his horse sideways, and slipped down to aim his rifle
across the saddle. It was his first deer. He waited,
twitching and quivering with &#8220;buck fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the fore quarters of the animal became visible
to his excited gaze through a small gap in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
screening bushes. The muzzle of his rifle wobbled
all around the mark. Unable to steady it, he caught
the sights as they wavered into line, and pulled the
trigger.</p>
<p>The report of the shot was followed by a loud <i>bawl</i>
and a violent crashing in the thicket. There could be
no doubt that the animal had been hit and was seeking
to escape. It was running across the top of the ridge
towards the ca&ntilde;on. The hunter sprang around the
head of his pony and threw up his rifle, which had
automatically reloaded itself. As it came to his shoulder,
the wounded animal burst out of cover. It was a
yearling calf.</p>
<p>But the sportsman knew that he had shot a deer,
and a deer was all he saw. He was now fairly shaking
with the &#8220;fever.&#8221; His finger crooked convulsively
on the automatic firing lever. Instantly a
stream of bullets began to pour from the wildly wavering
muzzle, and empty shells whirred up from the
ejector like hornets.</p>
<p>Before the hunter could realize what was happening,
his magazine was exhausted, the last cartridge
fired, and the shell flipped out. But he paid no heed
to this. His eyes were on the fleeing calf. His cartridges
were smokeless. Through the slight haze
above his rifle muzzle he saw the animal pitch forward
and fall heavily upon the round of the ridge. It
did not move.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>Tugging at the bridle to quicken his horse&#8217;s pace, he
hastened forward to examine his game. He was still
so excited that he was almost upon the outstretched
carcass before he noticed the odd scar on its side. He
bent down and saw that the mark was a cattle brand
seared on the hide with a hot iron.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to jump on his pony and ride
off. He was about to set his foot in the stirrup when
the apprehensive glance with which he was peering
around shifted down to the ca&ntilde;on. His gaze traveled
back from the near edge of the chasm, up the two
hundred yards of slope, and rested on the yearling as
though estimating its weight.</p>
<p>It was a fat, thoroughbred Hereford. He could
not lift it on his pony, and he had no rope to use as a
drag-line. He shook his head. But the pause had
given him time to recover from his panic. He
shrugged his shoulders, drew a silver-handled hunting
knife, and awkwardly set about dressing his kill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A YEARLING SOLD</h3>
</div>
<p>Three riders came galloping along the ridge towards
the hunter. At sight of his pony the
grizzled cowman in the lead signed to his companions
and came to a sudden stop behind a clump of service-berry
bushes. The others swerved in beside him, the
bowlegged young puncher on the right with his hand
at his hip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumping Jehosaphat!&#8221; he exulted. &#8220;We shore
have got him, Mr. Knowles, the blasted&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His
thin lips closed tight to shut in the oath as he turned
his gaze on the lovely flushed face of the girl beside
him. When his cold gray eyes met hers they lighted
with a glow like that of fire through ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better stay here, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; he advised.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to cure that rustler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Kid, what if&ndash;&ndash;No, no! wait!&#8221; she cried
at sight of his drawn Colt&#8217;s. &#8220;Daddy, stop him!
The man may not be a rustler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard the shooting,&#8221; answered the cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he may have been after a deer,&#8221; answered
the girl, lifting her lithe figure tiptoe in the stirrups
of her man&#8217;s saddle to peer over the bushes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Deer?&#8221; rejoined the puncher. &#8220;Who&#8217;d be deer-hunting
in July?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a bear. He fired fast enough,&#8221; remarked
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much chance of that round here,&#8221; said the
cowman. &#8220;Still, it might be. At any rate, Kid, this
time I want you to wait for me to ask questions <i>before</i>
you cut loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he don&#8217;t try any funny business,&#8221; qualified the
puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course,&#8221; assented Knowles. &#8220;Chuckie, you best
stay back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Daddy. There&#8217;s only one man and between
you and Kid&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sho!</i> Come on, then, if you&#8217;re set on it. Kid,
you circle to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher wheeled his horse and rode off around
the chaparral. The girl and Knowles, after a short
wait, advanced upon the hunter. They were soon
within a few yards of him and in plain view. His
pony stopped browsing and raised its head to look at
them. But the man was stooped over, with his face
the other way, and the incessant, reverberating roar
of the ca&ntilde;on muffled the tread of their horses on the
dusty turf.</p>
<p>The puncher crashed through the corner of the
thicket and pulled up on the top of the slope immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
opposite the hunter. The latter sprang to his
feet. The puncher instantly covered him with his
long-barreled revolver and snapped tersely: &#8220;Hands
up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&ndash;&ndash;ante!&#8221; gasped the hunter. &#8220;A&ndash;&ndash;a road
agent!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he did not throw up his hands. With the rash
bravery of inexperience, he dropped his knife and
snatched out his automatic pistol. On the instant the
puncher&#8217;s big revolver roared. The pistol went spinning
out of the hunter&#8217;s hand. Through the smoke
of the shot the puncher leveled his weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put up your hands!&ndash;&ndash;put them up!&#8221; screamed
the girl, urging her horse forward.</p>
<p>The hunter obeyed, none too soon. For several
moments he stood rigid, glaring half dazed at the
revolver muzzle and the cool hard face behind it.
Then slowly he twisted about to see who it was had
warned him. The girl had ridden up within a few
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you <i>tenderfoot</i>!&#8221; she flung at him. &#8220;Are
you locoed? Hadn&#8217;t you any more sense than to do
that? Why, if Daddy hadn&#8217;t told Mr. Gowan to
wait&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shore would have got yours, you&ndash;&ndash;rustler!&#8221;
snapped the puncher. &#8220;It was you, though, Miss
Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;your being here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s not a rustler, Kid,&#8221; protested the girl.
&#8220;Where are your eyes? Look at his riding togs. If
they&#8217;re not tenderfoot, howling tenderfoot&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, honey, he&#8217;s shot a yearling,&#8221; said
Knowles, frowning at the culprit. &#8220;Suppose you let
me do the questioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;pardon me,&#8221; remarked the hunter, rebounding
from apprehension to easy assurance at sight of
the girl&#8217;s smile. &#8220;I would prefer to be third-degreed
by the young lady. Permit me to salute the Queen of
the Outlaws!&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent over the fingers of one hand to raise his
silver-banded sombrero by its high peak. It left his
head&ndash;&ndash;and a bullet left the muzzle of the puncher&#8217;s
revolver. A hole appeared low down in the side of
the sombrero.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, Kid,&#8221; ordered the cowman. &#8220;No
more hazing, even if he is a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tenderfoot?&#8221; replied Gowan, his mouth like a
straight gash across his lean jaws. &#8220;How about his
drawing on me&ndash;&ndash;and how about your yearling?
That bullet went just where it ought to &#8217;ve gone with
his hat down on his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no jesting even of the grimmest quality
in the puncher&#8217;s look and tone. He was very cool and
quiet&ndash;&ndash;and his Colt&#8217;s was leveled for another shot.</p>
<p>The hunter thrust up his hands as high as he could
reach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you surely can&#8217;t intend to murder me!&#8221;
he stammered, staring from the puncher to the cowman.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay ransom&ndash;&ndash;anything you ask! Don&#8217;t
let him shoot me! I&#8217;m Lafayette Ashton&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll
pay thousands&ndash;&ndash;anything! My father is George
Ashton, the great financier!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;New York?&#8221; queried Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Chicago! He&ndash;&ndash;If only you&#8217;ll write
to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl burst into a ringing laugh. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she
cried, the moment she could speak, &#8220;Oh, Daddy!
don&#8217;t you see? He really thinks we&#8217;re a bunch of
wild and woolly bandits!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hunter looked uncertainly from her dimpled
face to Gowan&#8217;s ready revolver. Turning sharply
about to the cowman, he caught him in a reluctant grin.
With a sudden spring, he placed the girl between himself
and the scowling puncher. Behind this barrier of
safety he swept off his hat and bowed to the girl with
an exaggerated display of politeness that hinted at
mockery.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s merely a cowboy joke,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I bend,
not to the Queen of the Outlaws, but to the Princess
of the Cows!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dimples vanished. She looked over his head
with the barest shade of disdain in her expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;The joke came near to being on us,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Kid, put up your gun. A tenderfoot who has enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
nerve and no more sense than to draw when you have
the drop on him, you&#8217;ve hazed him enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan sullenly reloaded his Colt&#8217;s and replaced it
in its holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Knowles; but he turned
sharply upon the offender. &#8220;Look here, Mr. Ashton,
if that&#8217;s your name&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s still the matter of
this yearling. Shooting stock in a cattle country isn&#8217;t
any laughing matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, I say,&#8221; replied the hunter, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
it was your cow, really I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t make any difference whose brand was on
the calf. Even if it had been a maverick&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s it!&#8221; interrupted Ashton. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
see the brand&ndash;&ndash;only glimpses of the beast in the
chaparral. I thought it a deer until after it fell and
I came up to look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shore did,&#8221; jeered Gowan. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
you was hurrying to yank off the hide. No chance of
proving a case on you with the brand down in Deep
Ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed no,&#8221; replied Ashton, drawing a trifle closer
to the girl&#8217;s stirrup. &#8220;You are quite wrong&ndash;&ndash;quite.
I was dressing the animal to take it to my camp. Because
I had mistaken it for a deer was no reason why
I should leave it to the coyotes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business you got hunting deer out of season?&#8221;
questioned Knowles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but are you the game warden?&#8221; asked
Ashton, with a supercilious smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind about that,&#8221; rejoined the cowman.
&#8220;Just you answer my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged, and replied in a bored tone: &#8220;I
fail to see that it is any of your affair. But since you
are so urgent to learn&ndash;&ndash;I prefer to enjoy my sport
before the rush of the open season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s against the law?&#8221; exclaimed
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;as to that, a trifling fine&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; drawled the
hunter, again shrugging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted Knowles. &#8220;A fine might get
you off for deer. Shooting stock, though, is a penitentiary
offense&ndash;&ndash;when the criminal is lucky enough
to get into court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Criminal!&#8221; repeated Ashton, flushing. &#8220;I have
explained who I am. My father could buy out this
entire cattle country, and never know it. I&#8217;ll do it
myself, some day, and turn the whole thing into a
game preserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you do,&#8221; warned Gowan, &#8220;you&#8217;d better
hunt a healthier climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re concerned with now,&#8221; interposed
Knowles, &#8220;is this yearling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The live or the dead one, Daddy?&#8221; asked the
girl, her cheeks dimpling.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you&ndash;&ndash;Aw&ndash;&ndash;<i>haw! haw! haw!</i>&ndash;&ndash;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
live or the dead one! Catch that, Kid? The live or
the dead one! <i>Haw! haw! haw!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowman fairly roared with laughter. Neither
of the young men joined in his hilarious outburst.
Gowan waited, cold and unsmiling. Ashton stiffened
with offended dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you that the shooting of the animal was
unintentional,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall settle the affair by
paying you the price usually asked for veal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will?&#8221; said the cowman, looking down at the
indignant tenderfoot with a twinkle in his mirth-reddened
eyes. &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t usually sell veal on the
range. But I&#8217;ll let you have this yearling at cutlet
prices. Fifty dollars is the figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Daddy,&#8221; interrupted the girl, &#8220;half that
would be&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the hoof, yes; but he&#8217;s buying dressed veal,&#8221;
broke in the cowman, and he smiled grimly at the culprit.
&#8220;Fifty dollars is cheap for a deer hunter who
goes round shooting up the country out of season. He
can take his choice&ndash;&ndash;pay for his veal or make a trip
to the county seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s talking, Mr. Knowles,&#8221; approved Gowan.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll corral him at Stockchute in that little log calaboose.
He&#8217;ll have a peach of a time talking the jury
out of sending him up for rustling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outrage&ndash;&ndash;rank robbery!&#8221; complained
Ashton. &#8220;Of course you know I will pay rather than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
be inconvenienced by an interruption of my hunting.&#8221;
He thrust his slender hand into his pocket, and drew
it out empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead broke!&#8221; jeered Gowan.</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged disdainfully. &#8220;I have money at
my camp. If that is not enough to pay your blackmail,
my valet has gone back to the railway with my
guide for a remittance of a thousand dollars, which
must have come on a week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your camp is at the waterhole on Dry Fork,&#8221;
stated Knowles. &#8220;Saw a big smoke over there&ndash;&ndash;tenderfoot&#8217;s
fire. Well, it&#8217;s only five miles, and we
can ride down that way. We&#8217;ll go to your camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es?&#8221; murmured Ashton, his ardent eyes on
the girl. &#8220;Miss&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Chuckie, it is superfluous to
remark that I shall vastly enjoy a cross-country ride
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, really!&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>Heedless of her ironical tone, he turned a supercilious
glance on Knowles. &#8220;Yes, and at the same
time your papa and his hired man can take advantage
of the opportunity to deliver my veal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; growled the cowman, flushing
hotly.</p>
<p>But the girl burst into such a peal of laughter that
his scowl relaxed to an uncertain smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the joke, honey?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; she cried, her blue eyes glistening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
with mirthful tears. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s got you,
Daddy? You didn&#8217;t sell him his meat on the hoof.
You&#8217;ve got to dress and deliver his cutlets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James!&#8221; vowed Gowan. &#8220;Before I&#8217;ll
butcher for such a knock-kneed tenderfoot I&#8217;ll see
him, in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your hawsses, Kid,&#8221; put in Knowles. &#8220;The
joke&#8217;s on me. You go on and look for that bunch
of strays, if you want to. But I&#8217;m not going to back
up when Chuckie says I&#8217;m roped in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan looked fixedly at Ashton and the girl, swore
under his breath, and swung to the ground. He came
down beside the calf with the waddling step of one
who has lived in the saddle from early childhood.
Knowles joined him, and they set to work on the calf
without paying any farther heed to the tenderfoot.</p>
<p>Ashton, after fastidiously wiping his hands on a
wisp of grass, placed his hunting knife in his belt and
his rifle in its saddle sheath. He next picked up his
pistol, but after a single glance at the side plate,
smashed in by Gowan&#8217;s first shot, he dropped the
ruined weapon and rather hurriedly mounted his pony.</p>
<p>The girl had faced away from the partly butchered
carcass. As Ashton rode around alongside, her pony
started to walk away. Instead of reining in, she
glanced demurely at Ashton, and called over her
shoulder: &#8220;Daddy, we&#8217;ll be riding on ahead. You
and Kid have the faster hawsses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; acquiesced Knowles, without pausing
in his work.</p>
<p>Gowan said nothing; but he glanced up at the jaunty
back of the tenderfoot with a look of cold enmity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>QUEEN OF WHAT?</h3>
</div>
<p>Heedless of the men behind him, Ashton rode
off with his ardent gaze fixed admiringly upon
his companion. The more he looked at her the more
astonished and gratified he was to have found so
charming a girl in this raw wilderness.</p>
<p>As a city man, he might have considered the healthy
color that glowed under the tan of her cheeks a trifle
too pronounced, had it not been offset by the delicate
mold of her features. Her eyes were as blue as alpine
forget-me-nots.</p>
<p>Though she sat astride and the soft coils of her
chestnut hair were covered with a broad-brimmed felt
hat, he was puzzled to find that there really was nothing
of the Wild West cowgirl in her costume and bearing.
Her modest gray riding dress was cut in the
very latest style. If her manner differed from that
of most young ladies of his acquaintance, it was only
in her delightful frankness and total absence of affectation.
Yet she could not be a city girl on a visit, for
she sat her horse with the erect, long-stirruped, graceful,
yielding seat peculiar to riders of the cattle ranges.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he gave voice to his curiosity, as
she directed their course slantingly down the ridge
away from Deep Ca&ntilde;on, &#8220;I am simply dying to learn,
Miss Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better make it &#8216;Miss Knowles,&#8217;&#8221;
she suggested, with a quiet smile that checked the familiarity
of his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&ndash;&ndash;pardon me!&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Miss Knowles,&#8217; of
course,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;But, you know, so unusual
a name&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Chuckie?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It formerly
was quite common in the West&ndash;&ndash;was often used as
a nickname. My real name is Isobel. I understand
that Chuckie comes from the Spanish Chiquita.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chiquita!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;But that is not a
regular name. It is only a term of endearment, like
Nina. And you say Chuckie comes from Chiquita?
Chiquita&ndash;&ndash;dear one!&#8221;</p>
<p>His large dark eyes glowed at her brilliant with
audacious admiration. Her color deepened, but she
replied with perfect composure: &#8220;You see why I
prefer to be addressed as &#8216;Miss Knowles&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you permitted that common cowpuncher to
call you Miss Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled ironically. &#8220;For one thing, Mr.
Ashton, I have known Kid Gowan over eight years,
and, for another, he is hardly a <i>common</i> cowpuncher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks ordinary enough to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; she rallied. &#8220;I should have
thought that even to the innocent gaze of a tenderfoot&ndash;&ndash;Let
me hasten to explain that the common
or garden variety of cowshepherd is to be distinguished
in many respects from his predecessor of the
Texas trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Texas trail?&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;Now I know you&#8217;re
trying to string me. This Gowan can&#8217;t be much older
than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl dropped her bantering tone, and answered
soberly: &#8220;He is only twenty-five, and yet he is a full
generation older than you. He was born and raised
in a cow camp. He is one of the few men of the type
that remain to link the range of today with the vanished
world of the cattle frontier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you say that the fellow is only my age?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In years, yes. But in type he belongs to the generation
that is past&ndash;&ndash;the generation of longhorns,
long drives, long Colt&#8217;s, and short lives; of stampedes,
and hats like yours, badmen, and Injins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you cannot mean that this&ndash;&ndash;You called
him &#8216;Kid.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid Gowan,&#8221; she confirmed. &#8220;Yes, he holds to
the old traditions even in that. There are six notches
on the hilt of his &#8216;gun,&#8217; if you count the two little
ones he nicked for his brace of Utes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! He is a real Indian fighter, like Kit
Carson?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it was merely a band of hide hunters that
came over the line from Utah, and Mr. Gowan helped
the game warden run them back to their reservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He actually killed two of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl, her gravity deepening to
a concerned frown. &#8220;The worst of it is that I&#8217;m
not altogether certain it was necessary. Men out
here, as a rule, think much too little of the life of an
Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; murmured Ashton. &#8220;Two Indians. But
didn&#8217;t you speak of six notches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six,&#8221; confirmed the girl, her brow partly clearing.
&#8220;The others were different. Three were rustlers.
The sheriff&#8217;s posse overtook them. Both sides were
firing. Kid circled around and shot three. He happened
to have a long-range rifle. Daddy says they
threw up their hands when the first one fell; but Kid
explained to me that he was too far away to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; murmured Ashton the second time, and he
put up his hand to the hole in the front of his sombrero.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last was two years ago,&#8221; went on the girl.
&#8220;There was a dispute over a maverick. Kid was
tried and acquitted on his plea of self-defense. There
were no witnesses. He claimed that the other man
drew first. Two empty shells were found in the
other man&#8217;s revolver, and only one in Kid&#8217;s. That
cleared him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>Ashton took off his hat and stared at the holes
where the heavy forty-four bullet had gone in and
gone out. He was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, poor Kid has been unfortunate,&#8221; remarked
the girl, as she headed her pony down over
the edge of the mesa. &#8220;That time with the rustlers,
all the posse were firing, and he just happened to be
the one that got the best aim; and the time with the
Indians, I&#8217;m sure he did not shoot to kill. It just
happened that way. He told me so himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton ran his tongue over his lip. &#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I suppose
so,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid has all the good qualities and only a few of
the faults of the old-time cowboys,&#8221; went on the girl.
&#8220;He is almost fiercely loyal to Daddy&#8217;s interests.
That&#8217;s why he led a raid on a sheep outfit, four years
ago, when almost half of a large flock were run over
into Deep Ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;poor innocent beasts! Daddy
was furious with Kid; but there was no legal proof as
to who were members of the attacking party, and the
sheep were destroying our range. All of Daddy&#8217;s
cattle would have starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not punished?&#8221; murmured Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy could not be expected to discharge him,
could he, when Kid did it to save our range? You
see, it was just because he was so very loyal. You
must not think from these things that he&ndash;&ndash;It is true
he is suspicious of strangers, but he always has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
very kind and gentle to me. I am very fond of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton, stirred from his
uneasy depression. &#8220;I should hardly have thought
him the kind to interest a girl like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; she bantered. &#8220;Why not? I have
lived on the range ever since I was fourteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her incredulously. &#8220;Since you were
fourteen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For nine years,&#8221; she added, smiling at his astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;it can&#8217;t be,&#8221; he protested, his eyes on her
stylish costume. &#8220;At least, not all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded at him encouragingly. &#8220;So you <i>can</i>
see&ndash;&ndash;a little. Nearly all my winters have been spent
in Denver, except one in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t cross in a cattle boat,&#8221; she flashed back
at him, dimpling mischievously. &#8220;Nor did I go as
the Queen of the Rancho, or of the Roundup, or even
of the Wild and Woolly Outlaw Band.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flushed with mortification. &#8220;I am only too
well aware, Miss Knowles, how you must regard me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do not regard you at all&ndash;&ndash;as yet,&#8221; she
bantered. &#8220;But of course I could not expect you to
know that Daddy&#8217;s sister is one of the Sacred Thirty-six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sacred&ndash;&ndash;? Is that one of the orders of nuns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; she punned. In the same moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
she drew a most solemn looking face. &#8220;My
deah Mistah Ashton, I will have you to understand
my reference was to that most select coterie which
comprises Denver&#8217;s Real Society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; he said, with a subtle alteration in his
tone and manner. &#8220;You say that your aunt is one
of&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt by adoption,&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adoption?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not Daddy&#8217;s natural daughter. He adopted
me,&#8221; explained the girl in her frank way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked Ashton, plainly eager to learn more
of her history.</p>
<p>Without seeming to observe this, she adroitly
balked his curiosity&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;So, you see, Daddy&#8217;s sister is
only my aunt by adoption. Still, she has been very,
very good to me; though I love Daddy and this free
outdoor life so much that I insist on coming back home
every spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Really, Miss
Knowles, you must think me a good deal of a dub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, allowances should be made for a tenderfoot,&#8221;
she bantered.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I recognized your queenliness, even if
at first I did mistake what you were queen of,&#8221; he
thrust back.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you still insist I&#8217;m a queen? Of what, pray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Hearts!&#8221; he answered with fervor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>His daring was rewarded with a lovely blush. But
she was only momentarily disconcerted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Though
it&#8217;s not Queen of Spades, because I do not have to
work; and it can&#8217;t be Diamonds, because Daddy is no
more than comfortably well to do&ndash;&ndash;only six thousand
head of stock. But as for Hearts&ndash;&ndash;No, I&#8217;m sure
it must be Clubs; I do so love to knock around.
Really, if ever they break up this range, it will break
my heart same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break up the range? How do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it under irrigation and turn it into orchards
and farms, as they have done so many places here on
the Western Slope. You know, Colorado apples and
peaches are fast becoming famous even in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wonder, not in the least&ndash;&ndash;if I am to
judge from a certain sample of the Colorado peach,&#8221;
he ventured.</p>
<p>This time she did not blush. &#8220;I am quite serious,
Mr. Ashton,&#8221; she reproved him. &#8220;Daddy owns only
five sections. The rest of his range is public land.
If settlers should come in and homestead it, he would
have to quit the cattle business. You cannot realize
how fearfully we are watching the irrigation projects&ndash;&ndash;all
the Government reclamation work, and the
private dams, too. There seems to be no water that
can be put on Dry Mesa, yet the engineers are doing
such wonderful things these days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Ashton straightened on his saddle. &#8220;That is quite
true, Miss Knowles. You know, I myself am an engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed in dismay. &#8220;You, an engineer?
Have you come here to see if our mesa can be
irrigated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, no, I shall not do that,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I have not the slightest thought of such a project. I
am merely out for sport.&#8221;</p>
<p>She eyed him uncertainly. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;We get all
the reports&ndash;&ndash;There is an Ashton connected with
that wonderful Zariba Dam, just being finished in
Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my father. He is interested in it with
a Mr. Leslie. They are financing the project. But
I have nothing to do with it, nothing whatever, I assure
you. The engineer is another man, a fellow
named&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as if unable to remember. The girl
looked at him with a shade of disappointment in her
clear eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Mr. Blake&ndash;&ndash;Thomas Blake,&#8221; she supplied the
name. &#8220;I thought you might have known him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;Blake?&#8221; he murmured hesitatingly.
&#8220;Why, yes, I did at one time have somewhat of an
acquaintance with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; she cried, her eyes brilliant with excitement.
&#8220;Oh, tell me! I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She faltered under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
his surprised stare, and went on rather lamely: &#8220;You
see, I&ndash;&ndash;we have been immensely interested in the
Zariba Dam. The reports all describe it as an extraordinary
work of engineering. And so we have
been curious to learn something about the engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you&#8217;re so opposed to irrigation projects?&#8221;
he thrust.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes no difference,&#8221; she parried. &#8220;We&ndash;&ndash;Daddy
and I&ndash;&ndash;cannot but admire such a remarkable
engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged. &#8220;The dam was a big thing. I
fail to see why you should admire Blake just because
he happened to blunder on the idea that solved the
difficulty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not like him,&#8221; she said with frank directness.</p>
<p>He hesitated and looked away. When he replied
it was with evident reluctance: &#8220;No, I do not. He
is&ndash;&ndash;You would hardly admire him personally, even
though he did bully Genevieve Leslie into marrying
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is married?&#8221; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you are surprised,&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;It
was the most amazing thing imaginable&ndash;&ndash;she the
daughter of H. V. Leslie, one of our wealthiest financiers,
and he a rough, uncouth drunkard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drunkard?&#8221; almost screamed the girl. &#8220;No,
no, not drunkard! I cannot believe it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly was one until just before Genevieve
married him,&#8221; insisted Ashton. &#8220;I hear he has managed
to keep sober since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-oh!&#8221; sighed Miss Isobel, making no effort to
conceal her vast relief. She attempted a smile. &#8220;I
am so glad to hear that he is all right now. Of course
he must be!... You say he married an heiress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is worth three millions in her own right, and
Leslie is as daft over him as she is. Leslie and my
father are the ones who backed him on the Zariba
Dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How interesting! And I suppose Mr. Blake is a
Western man. So many of the best engineers come
from the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton looked at her suspiciously. He could not
make out her interest in Blake. She apparently had
come to regard the engineer as a sort of hero. Yet
why should she continue to inquire about him, now
that she knew he was a married man?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I cannot tell you,&#8221; he replied, somewhat
stiffly. &#8220;The fellow seems to have come from nowhere.
Had it not been for an accident, he would
never have got within speaking distance of Genevieve,
but they happened to be shipwrecked together
alone&ndash;&ndash;on the coast of Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrecked?&ndash;&ndash;shipwrecked? How perfectly glorious!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind it myself&ndash;&ndash;with you!&#8221; he
flashed back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; she bantered. &#8220;This Mr. Blake, I
imagine, was hardly a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he was a roughneck,&#8221; muttered Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not like him,&#8221; she remarked the second
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I, a low fellow like that? I&#8217;ve
heard that he even brags that he started in the Chicago
slums.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl put her hand to her bosom. &#8220;In the&ndash;&ndash;the
Chicago slums!&#8221; she half whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you are surprised,&#8221; said Ashton.
&#8220;Anyone would presume that he would keep such a
disgrace to himself. It shows what he is&ndash;&ndash;absolutely
devoid of good taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he&ndash;&ndash;What does he look like?&#8221; she eagerly
inquired.</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged. &#8220;Pardon me. I prefer not to
talk any more about the fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Isobel checked her curiosity. &#8220;Very well,
Mr. Ashton.&#8221; She looked around, and suddenly
flourished her leathern quirt. &#8220;Look&ndash;&ndash;there are
Kid and Daddy trying to head us. Come on, if you
want a race. I&#8217;m going to beat them down to Dry
Fork.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_IV_DOWNHILL_AND_UP' id='CHAPTER_IV_DOWNHILL_AND_UP'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>DOWNHILL AND UP</h3>
</div>
<p>The lash of the quirt fell with a swish on the flank
of the girl&#8217;s pony. He did not wait for a second
hint, but started down the steep slope &#8220;on the
jump.&#8221; Before Ashton realized what was happening,
his own horse was following at the same breakneck
pace.</p>
<p>Down plunged the two ponies&ndash;&ndash;down, down, down
the sharply pitched mountain side, leaping logs and
stones, crashing through brush, scrambling or slithering
stiff-legged down rock slides. It was a wild race,
a race that would have been utterly foolhardy with
any other horses than these mountain bred cow ponies.
A single misstep would have sent horse and rider rolling
for yards, unless sooner brought up against tree
or rock.</p>
<p>Most of the color had left Ashton&#8217;s cheeks, but his
full lips were set in resolute lines. His gaze alertly
took in the ground before his horse and at the same
time the girl&#8217;s graceful, swaying figure. Fortunately
he knew enough to let his horse pick his own way.
But such a way as it was! Had not the two animals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
been as surefooted as goats and as quick as cats, both
must have pitched head over heels, not once, but a
score of times.</p>
<p>They had leaped down over numbers of rocks and
logs and ledges, and the girl had not cast back a single
glance to see if Ashton was following. But as they
plunged down an open slope she suddenly twisted
about and flung up a warning hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a jump!&#8221; she cried&ndash;&ndash;as though they had
not been jumping every few yards since the beginning
of that mad descent.</p>
<p>Hardly had she faced about again when her pony
leaped and dropped with her clear out of sight. Ashton
gasped and started to draw rein. He was too
late. Three strides brought his horse to a ledge fully
six feet high. The beast leaped over the edge without
making the slightest effort to check himself.</p>
<p>Ashton uttered a startled cry, but poised himself
for the shock with the cleverness of a skillful rider.
His pony landed squarely, and at once started on again
as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>
<p>The girl was already racing down the lower slope,
which was more moderate, or rather, less immoderate
than that above the ledge. She looked around and
waved her hand gayly when she saw that Ashton had
kept his seat.</p>
<p>The salute so fired him that he gave his pony the
spur and dashed recklessly down to overtake her. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
last he raced alongside and a little past her. She
looked at his overridden pony and drew rein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Better pull up a bit.
You don&#8217;t want to blow your hawss. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t everyone
can take that jump as neatly as he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the others?&#8221; he panted&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;they&#8217;ll beat us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They cut down to the right. It&#8217;s nothing to
worry about if they do head us. They&#8217;ve got the
best hawsses. We&#8217;ll jog the rest of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he hastened to agree, &#8220;if you prefer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to lope uphill and down, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she
nodded towards his pony&#8217;s heaving flanks&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;no use
riding a willing hawss to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger of that with this old nag. He&#8217;s tough
as a mule,&#8221; Ashton assured her, though he followed
her example by pulling his mount in to a walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mule knows enough to balk when he&#8217;s got
enough,&#8221; she informed him.</p>
<p>He did not reply. With the lessening of his excitement
habit sent his hand to his open packet of cigarettes.
He had not smoked since before shooting the
calf. As they came down into the shallow valley between
the foot of the mesa and a parallel line of low
rocky hills he could wait no longer. His lighter was
already half raised to the gilt-tipped cigarette when
it was checked by etiquette. He bowed to the girl as
a matter of form.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, pardon me&ndash;&ndash;if you have no objections,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; was her unexpected reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221; he asked, his finger on the spring
of the lighter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You inquired if I have any objections,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I told you the truth. I dislike cigarettes
most intensely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he stammered, completely taken
aback, &#8220;don&#8217;t your cowboys all smoke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not cigarettes&ndash;&ndash;where I ever see them,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And cigars or pipes?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;One has to concede something to masculine weakness,&#8221;
she sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I have no cigars with me, not even
at my camp, and a pipe is so slow,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pray, do not deprive yourself on my account,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find the cut between those two hills
about as short a way to your camp as this one, if you
prefer your cigarettes to my company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crool maid!&#8221; he reproached, not altogether jestingly.
He even looked across at the gap through the
hills to which she was pointing. Then he saw the
disdain in her blue eyes. He took the cigarette from
his lips, eyed it regretfully, and flung it away with a
petulant fillip.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said. Meeting her amused smile, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
added in the injured tone of a spoiled child. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t realize what a compliment that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&ndash;&ndash;abstaining for a half hour or so? If
I asked you to break off entirely, and you did it, I
would consider that a real compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am by no means sure that I would care to
ask you,&#8221; she bantered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not? Why, may I inquire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not like to make useless requests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Useless!&#8221; he exclaimed, his self-esteem stung by
her raillery. &#8220;Do you think I cannot quit smoking
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you do not care to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Impulsively he snatched out a package of his expensive
cigarettes and tossed it over his shoulder.
Another and another and still others followed in rapid
succession, until he had exhausted his supply.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded her approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not so bad for a start-off,&#8221; she answered
with an absence of enthusiasm that dashed him from
his pose of self-abnegation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize what that means,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means, jilt Miss Nicotine in haste, and repent
at leisure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ragging me! You ought to be particularly
nice to me. I did it for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully. But I didn&#8217;t ask you to do it,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now, that&#8217;s hardly&ndash;&ndash;when I did it because
of what you said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I promise to be nice to you until events
do us part. That will be in about five minutes. Over
there is Dry Fork Gulch. The waterhole is just down
around this hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton took his ardent gaze off the girl&#8217;s face long
enough to glance to his left. He recognized the tremendous
gorge in the face of the mountain side that
he had tried to ascend the previous day. It ran in
with a moderately inclined bottom for nearly a mile,
and then scaled up to the top of High Mesa in steep
slopes and sheer ledges.</p>
<p>His eyes followed the dry gravelly creek bed
around to the right, and he nodded: &#8220;Yes, my camp
is just over the corner of those crags. But surely,
Miss Knowles, you will not end our acquaintance
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She met his appealing look with a level glance.
&#8220;Seriously, Mr. Ashton, don&#8217;t you think you had better
move camp to another section? It seems to me
you have done quite enough unseasonable deer hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for him to reply, she urged her
horse into a lope. His own mount was too jaded for
a quick start. When he overtook the girl she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
rounded the craggy hill on their right and was in sight
of a scattered grove of boxelders below a dike of dark
colored trap rock that outcropped across the bed of
the creek.</p>
<p>Above the natural dam made by this dike the valley
was bedded up with sand and large gravel washed
down by the torrential rush of spring freshets. Below
it the same wild floods, leaping down in a twenty-foot
fall, had gouged out a pothole so wide and deep that
it was never empty of water even in the driest seasons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>INTO THE DEPTHS</h3>
</div>
<p>At the top of the bank made by the dike the girl
pointed with her quirt down to the rock-rimmed
pool edge where a pair of riders were just swinging
out of their saddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Daddy! We&#8217;re coming, Kid,&#8221; she called,
and she turned to explain to Ashton. &#8220;They came
around the other end of the hills; a longer way but
better going. How&#8217;s this? Thought you said you
were camped here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. Don&#8217;t you see the tent? It&#8217;s
right there among the&ndash;&ndash;Why, what&ndash;&ndash;where is
it?&#8221; cried Ashton, gaping in blank amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see,&#8221; replied the girl.</p>
<p>Their horses were scrambling down the short steep
slope to the pool, where the other horses were drinking
their fill of the cool water. The two men watched
Ashton&#8217;s approach, Knowles with an impassive gaze,
Gowan with cold suspicion in his narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, honey,&#8221; asked the cowman, &#8220;did you have
him pulling leather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and I didn&#8217;t lose him, either,&#8221; she replied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
with a mischievous glance at Gowan. &#8220;I took that
jump-off where the white-cheeked steer broke its neck.
He took it after me without pulling leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the puncher. &#8220;Mr. Tenderfoot
shore is some rider. We&#8217;re waiting for him now to
ride around and find that camp where we were to
deliver his veal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared with a puzzled, half-dazed expression
from the tentless trees beside him to the fore and
hind quarters of veal wrapped in slicker raincoats and
fastened on back of the men&#8217;s saddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Knowles. &#8220;Thought you
said you were camped here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am&ndash;&ndash;that is, I&ndash;&ndash;My tent was right there
between those two trees,&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;You see,
there are the twigs and leaves I had my valet collect
for my bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore&ndash;&ndash;valleys are great on collecting beds of
leaves and sand and bowlders,&#8221; observed Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s his fireplace,&#8221; said the girl, wheeling her
horse through a clump of wild rosebushes. &#8220;Yes,
and he&#8217;s right about the tent, too. It is a bed.
Here&#8217;s a dozen cigarette boxes and&ndash;&ndash;What&#8217;s this,
Mr. Ashton! Looks as if someone had left a note
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A note?&#8221; he muttered, slipping to the ground.</p>
<p>He ran over to the spot to which she was pointing.
On a little pile of stones, in front of where his tent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
had been pitched, a piece of coarse wrapping paper
covered with writing was fluttering in the light breeze.
He snatched it up and read the note with fast-growing
bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; sympathetically questioned the girl,
quick to see that he was in real trouble.</p>
<p>He did not answer. He did not even realize that
she had spoken. With feverish haste he caught up an
opened envelope that had lain under the paper.
Drawn by his odd manner, Knowles and Gowan came
over to stare at him. He had torn a letter from the
envelope. It was in typewriting and covered less than
a page, yet he gaped at it, reading and re-reading the
lines as if too dazed to be able to comprehend their
meaning.</p>
<p>Slowly the involved sentences burned their way into
his consciousness. As his bewilderment cleared, his
concern deepened to dismay, and from dismay to consternation.
His jaw dropped slack, his face whitened,
the pupils of his eyes dilated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; exclaimed the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;His voice was hoarse and strained.
He crumpled the letter in a convulsive grasp&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Matter?
I&#8217;m ruined!&ndash;&ndash;ruined! God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles and the girl were both silent before the
despair in the young man&#8217;s face. Gowan was more
obtuse or else less considerate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shore, you&#8217;re plumb busted, partner,&#8221; he ironically
condoled. &#8220;Your whole outfit has flown away on
the wings of the morning. Hope you won&#8217;t tell us the
pay for your veal has vamoosed with the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kid, for shame!&#8221; reproved the girl. &#8220;Of
course Daddy won&#8217;t ask for any pay&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton burst into a jangling high-pitched laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! there&#8217;s still my pony and saddle and rifle
and watch!&#8221; he cried, half hysterically. &#8220;Take them!
strip me! Here&#8217;s my hat, too! I paid forty-five
dollars for it&ndash;&ndash;silver band.&#8221; He flung it on the
ground. &#8220;There&#8217;s a hole in it&ndash;&ndash;I wish the hole
were through my head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, look here, son. Keep a stiff upper lip,&#8221;
said Knowles. &#8220;Don&#8217;t act like you&#8217;re locoed. It&#8217;s
all right about that veal, as Chuckie says, and you
oughtn&#8217;t to make such a fuss over the loss of a camp
outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp outfit?&#8221; shrilled Ashton. &#8220;If that were
all! if that were all! What shall I do? Lost&ndash;&ndash;all
lost!&ndash;&ndash;father&ndash;&ndash;all! Ruined! Oh, my God! What
shall I do? Oh, my God! Oh&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Anguish and
despair choked the cry in his throat. He collapsed in
a huddled, quivering heap.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sho!</i> It can&#8217;t be as bad as that, can it?&#8221; condoled
the cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away!&#8221; sobbed the prostrated man. &#8220;Go
away! Take my pony&ndash;&ndash;all! Only leave me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If ever I saw a fellow plumb locoed!&#8221; muttered
Gowan, half awe-struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll come to his senses if we leave him,&#8221;
suggested Knowles. He took a step towards Ashton.
&#8220;All right, son, we&#8217;ll go. But we&#8217;ll leave you half
that veal, and we won&#8217;t take your hawss. D&#8217;you want
help in looking for your outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shook his downbent head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you want to let the thieves get away with
it, that&#8217;s your own lookout. You&#8217;d better strike back
to the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away! Leave me!&#8221; moaned Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to smash&ndash;&ndash;clean busted!&#8221; commented
Gowan, as he turned about to go to his horse, his spurs
jingling gayly.</p>
<p>Knowles followed him, shaking his head. The girl
had been gazing at Ashton with an expression that
varied from sympathetic commiseration to contemptuous
pity. As her adopted father and Gowan mounted,
she rode over to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll overtake you as soon as
I&#8217;ve watered my hawss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to speak to that kettle of mush
again, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; remonstrated Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am, Kid, and you know you wouldn&#8217;t stop
me if you could. He needs it. I&#8217;m glad you smashed
his pistol. A rifle is not so handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles stared over the bushes at the huddled figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
on the ground. &#8220;Look here, Chuckie, you can&#8217;t mean
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;He is ready to do it right
now, unless someone throws him a rope and hauls him
out of the slough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lot of fuss over a tenderfoot you never saw
before today,&#8221; grumbled Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not like you, Kid,&#8221; she reproached. &#8220;Besides,
you don&#8217;t want the trouble of digging a grave.
It would have to be deep, to keep out the coyotes.
Daddy, you&#8217;re forgetting the veal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am,&#8221; agreed the cowman. &#8220;Ride on, Kid.
You&#8217;ll be carrying most weight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher reluctantly wheeled his horse and
started down the bank of the dry stream. Knowles
unfastened the hind quarters of veal from behind the
cantle of his saddle, lifted them into a fork of one of
the low trees, and rode off after Gowan, folding up
his blood-stained slicker.</p>
<p>The girl at once slipped from her pony and walked
quietly around to the drooping, despairing man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton,&#8221; she softly began, &#8220;they have gone.
I have stayed to find out if there is anything I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused for him to reply. His shoulders quivered,
but he remained silent. She went on soothingly:
&#8220;You are all unstrung. The shock was too sudden.
It must have been a terrible one! Won&#8217;t you tell me
about it? Perhaps that will make you feel better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As if anything could when I am ruined, utterly
ruined!&#8221; he moaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how? Please tell me,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>Slowly he raised his haggard face and looked up at
her. There could be no question but that she was full
of sincere sympathy and concern for him. Her eyes
shone upon him with all the motherly tenderness that
any good woman, however young, has in her heart for
those who suffer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in this&ndash;&ndash;this letter,&#8221; he muttered
brokenly. &#8220;Expected my remittance in it&ndash;&ndash;Got
ruin! ruin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It had been opened,&#8221; suggested the girl. &#8220;Perhaps
those who took your outfit also took your remittance
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there wasn&#8217;t any&ndash;&ndash;not a cent! My valet
had my written instructions to open it and cash the
money orders&ndash;&ndash;that weren&#8217;t there! He and the
guide&ndash;&ndash;they came back. The letter had told them all,
all! I was not here. They took the outfit&ndash;&ndash;the
money&ndash;&ndash;divided it. Left that note&ndash;&ndash;they had no
more use for me.... Ruined! utterly ruined!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you wish us to run them down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;good riddance! What they took is less
than what I owed them. Ungrateful scoundrels!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; approved the girl. &#8220;Get up your
spunk. Cuss, if you like. Rip loose, good and hard.
It will ease you off.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he groaned, slumping back into his
posture of abject dejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come, now!&#8221; she encouraged. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
young, healthy man. What if you have been bucked
off this time? There are lots other hawsses in Life&#8217;s
corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hung his head lower.</p>
<p>She went on, in an altered tone: &#8220;Mr. Ashton,
it is evident you have been bred as a gentleman. I
wish you to give me your word that you will not put
an end to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a prolonged pause. At last he stirred as
if uneasy under her steady gaze. He could not see
her eyes, yet he seemed to feel them. Twice he
started to speak, but checked himself and hesitated.
The third time he muttered a reluctant, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;will
not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I have your word,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I
must go now. When you&#8217;ve shaken yourself together
a bit, come down to the ranch. You ride down Dry
Fork to the junction, and then three miles up Plum
Creek. Daddy&#8217;ll be glad to put you up a few days
until you can think of what to do to get a new start.
Good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>She went back to her horse as lightfooted and graceful
as an antelope. But he did not look up after her,
nor did he respond to her cordial parting. For a long
time after she rode away he continued to crouch as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
had left him, motionless, almost torpid with the immensity
of his loss.</p>
<p>The sun sank lower and lower. It touched the skyline
of High Mesa and dipped below. The shadow
of twilight fell upon Dry Fork and the waterhole.
The man shivered and, as if afraid that the darkness
would rush upon him, hastily opened his clenched hand
and smoothed out the crumpled letter.</p>
<p>To his bloodshot eyes, the accusing words seemed to
glare up at him in letters of fire:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><i>Sir</i>:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>We have been instructed by our client, Mr. George
Ashton, to inform you that he has at last learned the
full particulars of the manner in which you obtained

Michamac bridge; how you copied said plans and destroyed
the originals, and was awarded the construction

dissipation,&ndash;&ndash;our client has instructed us to inform

that any communication addressed to him by you,

read by him; and that he absolutely refuses to see you
or to grant you a personal interview.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'>Respectfully, etc.<br /></p>
<p>The signature was that of his father&#8217;s confidential
lawyers, and below, to the left, lest there be no possibility
of misunderstanding, were his name and address
in full: &#8220;Mr. Lafayette Ashton, Stockchute, Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he bent over with his head on his breast and
the letter clutched convulsively in his slender palm.</p>
<p>A bloodcurdling yell brought him to his feet with a
sudden leap. He still did not know the difference
between the cry of a coyote and the deeper note of a
timber wolf. He hastily started a fire, and ran to
fetch his rifle from the saddle sheath. The pony was
quietly munching a wisp of grass as best he could with
the bit in his mouth. The unconcern of the beast
reassured his master, who, however, filled the magazine
of his rifle before offsaddling.</p>
<p>Having hobbled the pony for the night, Ashton laid
the rifle on the rim of the pool, stripped, and dived in.
He went down like a plummet, reckless of the danger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
of striking some upjutting ledge. He may have forgotten
for the moment his word to the girl, or he may
have considered that it did not prevent him from courting
death by accident.</p>
<p>But, deeply as he dived, he failed to reach bottom.
He came up, puffing and blowing, and swam swiftly
around the pool before scrambling out to dress. The
combined effect of the vigorous exercise, the grateful
coolness of the water, and the riddance of the day&#8217;s
dust and sweat brought him ashore in a far less morbid
frame of mind. Going up the bank, he pulled the
hind quarters of veal from the tree and sliced off three
or four ragged strips with his knife. After washing
them, he put them to broil over his smoky fire of green
twigs. The &#8220;cutlets&#8221; came off, one half raw and the
other half burned to a crisp. But he had not eaten
since the early forenoon. He devoured the mess without
salt, ravenously. He topped off with the scant
swallow of brandy left in his flask.</p>
<p>Stimulated by the food and drink, he set about
gathering a large heap of wood. Three or four coyotes
had approached his camp, attracted by the scent of
the calf meat. With the fading of twilight into night
they came in closer, making such a racket with their
yelping and wailing that he thought himself surrounded
by a pack of ravenous wolves.</p>
<p>He could not see how his pony was unconcernedly
grazing within a few yards of one of the cowardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
beasts. Had the wistful singers been timber wolves,
the animal soon would have come hobbling in near the
fire; but Ashton did not know that. He flung on
brush and crouched down near the blaze, rifle in hand,
peering out into the blackness. Every moment he
expected to hear that terrible cry of which he had read,
the death-scream of a horse, and then to hear the
crunching of bones between the jaws of the ferocious
wolves.</p>
<p>He had spent the previous night alone in camp,
peacefully sleeping. But then the yells of the beasts
of darkness had been far away, and the walls of his
tent had shut him in from the wild. Tonight his
nerves had been shattered by the terrible blow of
his father&#8217;s repudiation. Worst of all, he had no
tobacco with which to soothe them.</p>
<p>His dread of the supposed wolf pack in a way eased
the anguish of his ruin by diverting his mind. But
the lack of cigarettes served only to put a more frightful
strain on his overwrought nerves. He felt it first
in a vague discomfort that set his hands to groping
automatically through his pockets. The absence of
the usual box roused his consciousness, with a dismayed
start, to the realization that he was absolutely
without his soothing drug. The absconding guide
and valet had taken the large store he had in camp,
and, to please Miss Knowles, he had flung away all
that were left in his pockets.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>From vague fumbling he instantly concentrated his
mind on an eager search for a packet that might have
been overlooked, either in his pockets or around the
camp. He could find none, nor even a single cigarette.
His nerves were now clamoring wildly for
their soothing poison. So great was the strain that it
began to affect his mind. He fancied that the wolf
pack was closing in to attack him. Twice he fired his
rifle at imaginary eyes out in the darkness.</p>
<p>All the time the craving for nicotine increased in
intensity, until he was half frantic. Midnight found
him, torch in hand, crawling around on the ground
where his tent had been pitched, hunting for cigarette
stubs. He had only to look close in order to find any
number. Most were no more than cork tips, but some
had at least one puff left in them, and a few had been
only half smoked.</p>
<p>Beside the bed he came upon almost a handful, close
together. By this time his jangled nerves were &#8220;toning
down.&#8221; He became conscious of great weariness.
He stretched out on his leafy bed, and with his head
pillowed on his arm, luxuriously sucked in the drugging
smoke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A TEST OF CALIBER</h3>
</div>
<p>When he opened his eyes the sun was beating
down into his face. He had slept far into the
morning. He stood up to stare around. His horse
was cropping the grass near the lower side of the
grove. There was no sign of any wolves. He
walked over to his fireplace. The fire had burned to
ashes hours ago. He started a fresh one with his
patent lighter, and turned to where he had left the
veal. It was gone.</p>
<p>He went a few steps farther, and found a bone
gnawed clean of every shred of meat and gristle. A
fox is a far less cunning thief than a coyote. The
quantity of calf meat had alone saved his saddle and
bridle, and even at that, one of the bridle reins was
slashed and the stirrup leathers were gnawed. He
looked from the white bone to the saddle, and ripped
out a half dozen vigorous Anglo-Saxon oaths. It was
not nice, but the explosion argued a far healthier
frame of mind than either his morbid hysteria of the
previous afternoon or his frenzy of the night.</p>
<p>After the outburst of anger had spent itself, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
realized that he was hungry. The feeling became
acute when he remembered that he had absolutely
nothing on hand to eat. He hastened to saddle up.
As he was about to mount he paused to look uncertainly
up the trail on which he had thrown away the
cigarettes. While he stood vacillating, his hand went
to his hip pocket and drew out the silver-cased brandy
flask. He looked at it, and its emptiness reminded
him that he was thirsty. He went down to the pool
for a drink. Having filled his flask, he returned up
the bank and sprang into the saddle.</p>
<p>His horse, in fine fettle after the night&#8217;s rest and
grazing, started off on the jump, cow pony fashion.
Ashton gave him his head, and the horse bore him at
a steady lope down along the stream, crossing over to
the other bank of the dry bed, of his own volition,
when the going became too rough on the near side.
The direction of the railway was now off across the
sagebrush flats to Ashton&#8217;s right, but he allowed his
horse to continue on down the creek. About four
miles from the waterhole he approached a bunch of
grazing cattle. He drew rein and walked his horse
past them, looking for a herder. There was none in
sight. The animals were on their home range. He
rode on down the creek at a canter.</p>
<p>A mile farther on, as he neared another scattered
bunch of cattle, something thwacked the dry ground
a little in front and to the left of him, throwing up a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
splash of sand and dust. His pony snorted and
leaped ahead at a quickened pace.</p>
<p>Ashton turned to look back at the spot&ndash;&ndash;and instinctively
ducked as a bullet pinged past his ear so
close that he felt the windage on his cheek. He did
not lack quickness of perception. He glanced up the
open slope to his left, and grasped the fact that someone
was shooting at him with a rifle from the crest of
the ridge half a mile distant.</p>
<p>Instantly he flung himself flat on his pony&#8217;s neck
and dug in his spurs. The pony bounded forward
with a suddenness that spoiled the aim of the third
bullet. It whined past over the beast&#8217;s haunches.
The fourth shot, best aimed of all, smashed the silver
brandy flask in Ashton&#8217;s hip pocket. Had he been
upright in the saddle, the steel-jacketed bullet must
have pierced him through the waist.</p>
<p>With a yell of terror, he flattened himself still
closer to his pony&#8217;s neck and dug in his spurs at every
jump. The beast was already going at a pace that
would have won most quarter-mile sprints. Just after
the fourth shot he swept in among the scattered bunch
of cattle, running at his highest speed. Still Ashton
swung his sharp-roweled spurs. He knew that the
range of a high-power rifle is well over a mile.</p>
<p>To his vast surprise, the shooting ceased the moment
he raced into line with the first steer. The short
respite gave him time to recover his wits.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>As the pony sprinted clear of the last steer in the
bunch, a fifth bullet ranged close down over Ashton&#8217;s
head. He pulled hard on the right rein and leaned
the same way. The sixth shot burned the skin on
the pony&#8217;s hip as he swerved suddenly towards the
edge of the creek channel. He made a wild leap out
over the edge of the cut bank and came plunging down
on a gravel bar. At once he started to race along the
dry stream bed. But instead of spurring, Ashton now
tugged at the bridle.</p>
<p>The pony swung to the left and came to a halt close
in under the bank. Ashton cautiously straightened
from his crouch. When erect he was just high enough
to see over the edge of the bank. Looking back and
up the ridge, he saw the figure of a man clearly outlined
against the sky. His lips closed in resolute
lines; his dark eyes flashed. Jerking out his rifle, he
set the sight for fifteen hundred yards, and began
firing at the would-be murderer as coolly and steadily
as a marksman.</p>
<p>Before he had pulled the trigger the third time the
man leaped sideways and knelt to return his fire. At
once Ashton gripped his rifle still more firmly and
drew back the automatic lever. The crackling discharge
was like the fire of a miniature Maxim gun.
Puffs of dust spouted up all around the man on the
ridge crest. He sprang to his feet and ran back out
of sight, jumping from side to side like an Indian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221; shouted Ashton. &#8220;He&#8217;s running! I
made him run!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat up very erect in his saddle, staring defiantly
at the place where the murderer had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coward! I made him run!&#8221; he exulted.</p>
<p>He shifted his grip on his rifle, and the heat of the
barrel reminded him that he had emptied the magazine.
He reloaded the weapon to its fullest capacity,
and stood up in his stirrups to stare at the ridge crest.
The murderer did not reappear. Ashton&#8217;s exultance
gave place to disappointment. He was more than
ready to continue the duel.</p>
<p>He rode down the creek, searching for a place to
ascend the cut bank. But by the time he came to a
slope he had cooled sufficiently to realize the foolishness
of bravado. Not unlikely the murderer was
lying back out of sight, ready to shoot him when he
came up out of the creek. He reflected, and decided
that the going was quite good enough in the bottom
of the creek bed. He rode on down the channel,
over the gravel bars, at an easy canter.</p>
<p>After a half mile the bank became so low and the
creek bed so sandy that he turned up on to the dry
sod. As he did so he kept his eye warily on the now
distant ridge. But no bullet came pinging down after
him.</p>
<p>Instead, he heard the thud of galloping hoofs, and
twisted about just in time to see a rider top a rise a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
short distance in front of him. He snapped down his
breech sight and faced the supposed assailant with the
rifle ready at his shoulder. Almost as quickly he
lowered the weapon and snatched off his sombrero in
joyful salute. The rider was Miss Knowles.</p>
<p>She waved back gayly and cantered up to him, her
lovely face aglow with cordial greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good noon!&#8221; she called. &#8220;So you have come at
last? But better late than never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I help coming?&#8221; he gallantly exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. The coyotes stole your cutlets, and you
were hungry,&#8221; she bantered, as she came alongside
and whirled her horse around to ride with him down
the creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you guess?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know coyotes,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;They&#8217;re the
worst&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She stopped short, gazing at the bleeding
flanks of his pony. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Ashton! how could
you? I did not think you so cruel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cruel?&#8221; he repeated, twisting about to see what
she meant. &#8220;Ah, you refer to the spurring. But I
simply couldn&#8217;t help it, you know. There was a
bandit taking pot shots at me as I passed the ridge
back there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bandit&ndash;&ndash;on Dry Mesa?&#8221; she incredulously
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he pegged at me eight or nine times.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>The girl smiled. &#8220;You probably heard one of the
punchers shooting at a coyote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he insisted, flushing under her look. &#8220;The
ruffian was shooting at me. See here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his hand to his left hip pocket, one side of
which had been torn out. From it he drew his
brandy flask.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was done by the third or fourth shot,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;Do you wonder I was flat on my pony&#8217;s
neck and spurring as hard as I could?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl took the flask from his outstretched hand
and looked it over with keen interest. In one side of
the silver case was a small, neat hole. Opposite it
half of the other side had been burst out as if by an
explosion within. She took off the silver cap, shook
out the shattered glass of the inner flask, and looked
again at the small hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thirty-eight,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I fail to&ndash;&ndash;Ah, yes;
thirty-eight caliber, you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I who must ask pardon,&#8221; she said in frank
apology. &#8220;Your rifle is a thirty-two. I heard a
number of shots, ending with the rattle of an automatic.
Thought you were after another deer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could afford to smile at the merry thrust and the
flash of dimples that accompanied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least it wasn&#8217;t a calf this time,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Nor was it a doe. But it may have been a buck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indian?&#8221; she queried, with instant perception of
his play on the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any war plumes,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;War plumes? Oh, that <i>is</i> a joke!&#8221; she exclaimed.
She chanced to look down at the shattered
flask, and her merriment vanished. &#8220;But this isn&#8217;t
any joke. Didn&#8217;t you see the man who was shooting
at you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, after I jumped my pony down into the creek.
Perhaps the bandit thought he had tumbled us both.
He stood up on top the ridge, until I cut loose and
made him run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ran?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s eyes sparkled at the remembrance, and his
chest began to expand. Then he met the girl&#8217;s clear,
direct gaze, and answered modestly: &#8220;Well, you
see, when I had got down behind the bank our positions
were reversed. He was the one in full view.
It&#8217;s curious, though, Miss Knowles&ndash;&ndash;shooting at
that poor calf, under the impression it was a deer, I
simply couldn&#8217;t hold my rifle steady, while&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder, if it was your first deer,&#8221; put in the
girl. &#8220;We call it buck fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but wouldn&#8217;t you have thought my first
bandit&ndash;&ndash;Why, I couldn&#8217;t have aimed at him more
steadily if I had been made of cast iron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he had made you fighting mad,&#8221; she bantered;
but under her seeming levity he perceived a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
change in her manner towards him immensely gratifying
to his humbled self-esteem.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I was just a trifle apprehensive&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
hesitated, and suddenly burst out with a candid confession&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;No,
not a trifle! Really, I was horribly
frightened!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was more than the girl had hoped from him.
She nodded and smiled in open approval. &#8220;You had
a good right to be frightened. I don&#8217;t blame you for
spurring that way. Look. It wasn&#8217;t only one shot
that came close. There&#8217;s a neat hair brand on your
hawss&#8217;s hip that wasn&#8217;t there yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been the shot just before we took the
bank,&#8221; said Ashton, twisting about to look at the
streak cut by the bullet. &#8220;The first was the only
other one that didn&#8217;t go higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did the man look like?&#8221; questioned Miss
Isobel. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine who&ndash;&ndash;Can it be that
your guide has a grudge against you on account of his
pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have thought it possible before yesterday,
though he was a surly fellow and inclined to be
insolent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All such men are apt to be with tenderfeet,&#8221; she
remarked, permitting herself a half twinkle of her
sweet eyes. &#8220;But I should have thought yours would
have kept on going. Whatever you may have owed
him, he had no right to steal your outfit. He must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
be a real badman, if it&#8217;s true he is the party who did
this shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised,&#8221; agreed Ashton.
In her concern over him she looked so charming that
he would have agreed if she had told him the moon
was made of green cheese.</p>
<p>She shook her head thoughtfully, and went on:
&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine even one of our badmen trying to
murder you that way. Their usual course would be
to come up to you, face to face, pick a quarrel, and
beat you to it on the draw. But whoever the cowardly
scoundrel is, we&#8217;ll turn out the boys, and either
run him down or out of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s my guide, he probably is running already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do! Don&#8217;t you want him punished?&#8221; exclaimed
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, but you see I don&#8217;t want Kid to&ndash;&ndash;to
cut another notch on his Colt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say, I cannot see how that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could if you realized how kind and good he
has been to me all these years. Do you know, when I
first came West, I couldn&#8217;t tell a jackrabbit from a
burro. Daddy had told me that each had big ears,
and I got them mixed. And actually I didn&#8217;t know
the off from the nigh side of a hawss!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;have horses and riding-schools in
the East,&#8221; put in Ashton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>She parried the indirect question without seeming
to notice it. &#8220;You proved that yesterday, coming
down from High Mesa. I felt sure I would have you
pulling leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pulling leather?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You see, I own to
my tenderfootness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grabbing your saddle to hold yourself on,&#8221; she
explained. Before he could reply, she rose in her
stirrups and pointed ahead with her quirt. &#8220;Look,
that&#8217;s the top of the biggest haystack, up by the feed-sheds.
You&#8217;ll see the buildings in half a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unheeded by Ashton, she had guided him off to the
left, away from Dry Fork, across the angle above its
junction with Plum Creek. They were now coming
up over the divide between the two streams. Ashton
failed to locate the haystack until its two mates and
the long, half-open shelter-sheds came into view.</p>
<p>A moment later he was looking at the horse corral
and the group of log ranch houses. Below and
beyond them the scattered groves of Plum Creek
stretched away up across the mesa&ndash;&ndash;green bouquets
on the slender silver ribbon of the creek&#8217;s midsummer
rill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;What do you think of my
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your summer home,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my real home,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Auntie
couldn&#8217;t be nicer or fonder than she is; but her house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
is a residence, not a home, even to her. Anyway,
here, where I have Daddy and Kid&ndash;&ndash;I do so hope
you and Kid will become friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you wish it, I shall try to do my part. But
it is a matter that might take time, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he
smiled ruefully and concluded with seeming irrelevance&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
have no home.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gazed at him with the look of tender motherly
sympathy that he had been too distraught to really
feel the previous day. &#8220;Do not say that, Mr. Ashton!
Though a ranch house is hardly the kind of
home to which you are accustomed, you will find that
we range folks retain the old-fashioned Western ideas
of hospitality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Knowles!&#8221; he exclaimed with
ardent gallantry, &#8220;the mere thought of being under
the same sky with you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;This <i>is</i> the blue
sky we are under, not a stuccoed ceiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I really meant it,&#8221; he protested, greatly
dashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid often says nice things to me. But he speaks
with his hands,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deaf and dumb alphabet?&#8221; he queried wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; she answered, dimpling under his
puzzled gaze. &#8220;Actions speak louder than words,
you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he murmured, and his look indicated that
she had given him food for thought.</p>
<p>They were now cantering down the long easy slope
towards the ranch buildings. The girl&#8217;s quick eye
perceived a horseman riding towards the ranch from
one of the groves up Plum Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Kid coming in,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;He
went out early this morning after a big wolf that had
killed a calf. He reported last evening that he found
the carcass over near the head of Plum Creek. A
wolf that gets to killing calves this time of year is a
pretty costly neighbor. Daddy told Kid to go out
and try to get him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t let him get <i>this</i> calf-killer,&#8221;
observed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, as soon as we saw your tenderfoot riding
togs&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;Seriously, though, you
must not mind if the men poke a little fun at you.
Most of them are more farmhands than cowboys, but
Kid will be apt to lead off. I do so want you to be
agreeable to Kid. He is almost a member of the
family, not a hired man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall try to be agreeable to him,&#8221; replied Ashton,
a trifle stiffly.</p>
<p>The puncher had seen them probably before they
saw him. He was riding at a pace that brought him
to the horse corral a few moments ahead of them.
When they came up he nodded carelessly in response
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
to Ashton&#8217;s studiously polite greeting, &#8220;Good day,
Mr. Gowan,&#8221; and turned to loosen the cinch of his
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been riding some,&#8221; remarked the girl,
looking at the puncher&#8217;s heaving, lathered horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumped that wolf&ndash;&ndash;ran him,&#8221; replied Gowan,
as he lifted off his saddle and deftly tossed it up on
the top rail of the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck,&#8221; congratulated Miss Isobel. She
explained to Ashton: &#8220;The cattlemen in this county
pay fifteen dollars for wolf scalps. That&#8217;s in addition
to the state bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton sprang off to offer her his hand. But she
was on the ground as soon as he. Gowan stared at
him between narrowed lids, and replied to the girl
somewhat shortly: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get him this time,
Miss Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t? That&#8217;s too bad! You don&#8217;t often
miss. I wish you had been with me, to run down the
scoundrel who tried to murder Mr. Ashton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan burst into the harsh, strained laughter of
one who seldom gives way to mirth. He checked
himself abruptly and cast a hostile look at Ashton.
&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James, Miss Chuckie, you don&#8217;t mean to say
you let a tenderfoot string you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about this?&#8221; asked the girl. She held out
the silver flask, which she had not returned to Ashton.</p>
<p>Gowan gave it a casual glance, and answered almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
jeeringly: &#8220;Easy enough for him to set it up and
plug it&ndash;&ndash;if he didn&#8217;t get too far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His rifle is a thirty-two. This was done by a
thirty-eight,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-eight?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see.&#8221; He
took the flask from her, drew a rifle cartridge from
his belt, and fitted the steel-jacketed bullet into the
clean, small hole. &#8220;You&#8217;re right, Miss Chuckie.
It shore was a thirty-eight.&#8221; He turned sharply on
Ashton. &#8220;Where&#8217;d it happen? Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over on that dry stream,&#8221; answered Ashton.
&#8220;Unfortunately the fellow was too far away for me
to be able to describe him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we think it may have been his guide,&#8221; explained
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guide?&#8221; muttered Gowan, staring intently at
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, if he was mean enough to help
steal Mr. Ashton&#8217;s outfit, he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore, I savvy!&#8221; exclaimed the puncher. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
rope a couple of fresh hawsses, and go out with Mr.
Ashton after the two-legged wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like you, Kid! But you must wait at least
until you&#8217;ve both had dinner. Mr. Ashton, I&#8217;m sure,
is half starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too, Miss Chuckie. But you know I&#8217;d
rather eat a wolf or a rustler or even a daring desperado
than sinkers and beans, any day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come in with us and see what Daddy has
to say about it,&#8221; the girl insisted.</p>
<p>She started to loosen her saddle-cinch. Gowan
handed back the silver flask, and stripping off saddle
and bridle from her horse, placed them on the rail
beside his own. Ashton waited, as if expecting a like
service. The puncher started off beside Miss Isobel
without looking at him. Ashton flushed hotly, and
hastened to do his own unsaddling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE CHANCE OF RECLAMATION</h3>
</div>
<p>Beyond the bunkhouse, which was the nearest
building to the corral, stood the low but roomy
log structure of the main ranch house. As Ashton
came around the front corner, close behind Gowan
and the girl, Knowles rose from his comfortable chair
in the rustic porch, knocked out the half burned contents
of his pipe and extended a freckled, corded hand
to the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Mr. Ashton! Glad to see you!&#8221; he
said with hearty hospitality. &#8220;Hope you&#8217;ve come to
ease up our lonesomeness by a month or two&#8217;s visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;You&#8217;re too kind, really!&#8221; replied
Ashton, his voice quavering and breaking at the unexpected
cordiality of the welcome. &#8220;If you&ndash;&ndash;I shall
take advantage of your generous offer. You see, I&#8217;m
rather in a box, owing to my&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He caught himself
up, and tightened his slackening lip. &#8220;But you&#8217;ll
pardon me if I ask you to let me do something in return
for your hospitality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t sell our hospitality on the range,&#8221;
brusquely replied the cowman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, I did not mean&ndash;&ndash;I could not pay a
penny. I&#8217;m utterly destitute&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;a pauper!&#8221; A
spasm of bitter despair contorted his handsome face.</p>
<p>Knowles and the girl hastily looked away from him,
that they might not see him in his weakness. But he
rallied and forced a rather unsteady laugh at himself.
&#8220;You see, I haven&#8217;t quite got used to it yet.
I&#8217;ve always had money. I never really had to work.
Now I must learn to earn a living. It&#8217;s very good of
you, Mr. Knowles, but&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s that veal. If only
you&#8217;ll let me work out what I owe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t owe me a cent for the yearling,&#8221; gruffly
replied the cowman. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know what I could put
you at, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might use him to shoo off the rattlers and jackrabbits
from in front the mowing machine,&#8221; suggested
Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton can ride,&#8221; interposed the girl, with a
friendliness of tone that brought Gowan to a thin-lipped
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; said Knowles, gazing speculatively
at the slim aristocratic figure of the tenderfoot.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not built for pitching hay, but like
as not you have the makings of a puncher. Ever
throw a rope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never. I shall start practicing the art&ndash;&ndash;at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not until you and Kid have had dinner,&#8221; gayly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
contradicted the girl. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had ours. But Yuki
always has something ready. Kid, if you&#8217;ll show Mr.
Ashton where to wash, I&#8217;ll tell Yuki.&#8221;</p>
<p>She darted through the open doorway into the
house. At a curt nod from Gowan, Ashton followed
him around to the far side of the house, leaving
Knowles in the act of hastily reloading his pipe. Under
a lean-to that covered a door in the side of the
house was a barrel of water and a bench with two
basins. On a row of pegs above hung a number of
towels, all rumpled but none dirty.</p>
<p>Gowan pointed to a box of unused towels, and proceeded
to lather and wash himself. Ashton took a
towel, and after rinsing out the second washbasin,
made as fastidious a toilet as the scant conveniences
of the place would permit. There were combs and a
fairly good mirror above the soap shelf. Gowan
went in by the side door, without waiting for his companion.
Ashton presently followed him, having
looked in vain for a razor to rid himself of his two
days&#8217; growth of beard.</p>
<p>The long table told him that he had entered the
ranch mess-hall, or rather, dining-room. Though the
table was covered with oilcloth and the rough-hewn
logs of the outer walls were lime-plastered only in
the chinks, the seats were chairs instead of benches,
and between the gay Mexican <i>serape</i> drapes of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
clean windows hung several well-done water color
landscapes, appropriately framed in unbarked pine.
On the oiled deal floor were scattered half a dozen
Navajo rugs.</p>
<p>Gowan had taken a seat at one end of the table.
As Ashton sat down at the neatly laid place opposite
him, a silent, smiling, deft-handed Jap came in from
the kitchen with a heaping trayful of dishes. For the
most part, the food was ordinary ranch fare, but
cooked with the skill of a <i>chef</i>. The exceptions were
the fresh milk and delicious unsalted butter. On most
cattle ranches, the milk comes from &#8220;tin cows&#8221; and
the butter from oleomargarine tubs.</p>
<p>The two diners were well along in their meal, eating
as earnestly and as taciturnly as the Jap served,
when Miss Isobel came in with her father. The girl
had dressed for the afternoon in a gown of the latest
style, whose quiet color and simple lines harmonized
perfectly with her surroundings. She smiled impartially
at puncher, tenderfoot, and Jap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Yuki. I see you did not keep our
hungry hunters waiting.&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Ashton, I have told
Daddy about that shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty strange happening. You might
tell us the full particulars,&#8221; said Knowles.</p>
<p>Ashton at once gave a fairly accurate account of the
affair. He could hardly exaggerate the peril he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
incurred, and the touch of exultance with which he
described his defeat of the murderer was quite pardonable
in a tenderfoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange&ndash;&ndash;mighty strange. Can&#8217;t understand
it,&#8221; commented the cowman when Ashton had finished
his account.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shore is, Mr. Knowles,&#8221; added Gowan. &#8220;The
only thirty-eight on the ranch is mine. That seems to
clear our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! It could not possibly be any of our
people!&#8221; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton thinks it might have been his guide,&#8221;
went on Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;His guide? What caliber was his rifle?&#8221;
shrewdly queried the cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;really I cannot remember,&#8221; answered
Ashton. &#8220;I know it was of a larger bore than mine,
but that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m,&#8221; considered Knowles. &#8220;Looks rather like
he&#8217;s the man. Can&#8217;t think of anyone else. Trouble
is, if he was laying in wait for you, his horse would be
fresh. Must have covered a right smart bit of territory
by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go out and take a look at his tracks,&#8221; said
Gowan, rising with a readiness that brought a nod of
approval from his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be careful, Kid,&#8221; cautioned the girl, with
a shade of concern in her tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll keep his eye open, Chuckie,&#8221; reassured her
father. &#8220;It&#8217;s the other fellow wants to be careful,
if he hasn&#8217;t already vamoosed. Hey, Kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him, if I get the chance,&#8221; laconically replied
Gowan, looking from the girl to Ashton with the
characteristic straightening of his lips that marked the
tensing of his emotions.</p>
<p>As he left the room Miss Isobel smiled and nodded
to Ashton. &#8220;You see how friendly he is, in spite of
his cold manner to strangers. I thought he had taken
a dislike to you, yet you saw how readily he offered to
go out after your assailant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely it&#8217;s because he thinks it would discredit
us to let such a scoundrel get away,&#8221; differed
her father. &#8220;However, he&#8217;ll leave you alone, Mr.
Ashton, if you stay with us as a guest, and will only
haze you a bit, if you insist upon joining our force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, working for you? I must insist on
that,&#8221; said Ashton, with an eager look at the girl.
&#8220;If only I can do well enough to be employed right
along!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowman grunted, and winked solemnly at his
daughter. &#8220;Yes, I can understand your feeling that
way. How about the winter, though? You mayn&#8217;t
like it over here so well then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton flushed and laughed at the older man&#8217;s
shrewdness; hesitated, and confessed candidly: &#8220;No,
I should prefer Denver in winter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>Miss Isobel blushed in adorable payment of his compliment,
but thrust back at him: &#8220;We bar cowboys
in the Sacred Thirty-six.&#8221;</p>
<p>He winced. Her stroke had pierced into his raw
wound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&ndash;&ndash;oh!&#8221; she breathlessly exclaimed. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean to&ndash;&ndash;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed the tears from his eyes. &#8220;No, you&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
apologize! It&#8217;s only that I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;Please
don&#8217;t fancy I&#8217;m a baby! You see, when a fellow has
always lived high&ndash;&ndash;on top, you know&ndash;&ndash;and then to
have everything go out from under him without warning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a stiff upper lip, son,&#8221; advised Knowles.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll pull through all right. It isn&#8217;t everyone in
your fix that would be asking for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton laughed a trifle unsteadily. &#8220;It&#8217;s very kind
of you to say that, Mr. Knowles. I&ndash;&ndash;I wish a
steady position, winter as well as summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Denver?&#8221; asked Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can wait,&#8221; replied Ashton. He met the
girl&#8217;s smile of approval, and rallied fully. &#8220;Yes, that
can wait&ndash;&ndash;and so can I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the girl blushed, but she found a bantering
rejoinder: &#8220;With you and Kid and Daddy all waiting
for me to come home, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to cut
the season short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The winters here are like those you read about up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
at the North Pole,&#8221; the cowman informed Ashton.
&#8220;But we get our sunshine back along in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy! you&#8217;re a poet!&#8221; cried his daughter,
flinging her arm around his sunburnt neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I were one!&#8221; enviously sighed Ashton.
The cowman gave him a look that brought him to his
feet. &#8220;Mr. Knowles,&#8221; he hastened to ask, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll
kindly tell me what my work is to be this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man&#8217;s frown relaxed. &#8220;Did you come
out here from Stockchute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you could find your way back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes; though we wandered all around&ndash;&ndash;But
surely, Mr. Knowles, you&#8217;ll not require me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a man to ride over with some letters and
fetch the mail. I&#8217;ll need Gowan for work you can&#8217;t
do. Chuckie was to have gone; but I can&#8217;t let her
now, until we&#8217;re more sure about that man who shot
at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, have you got the nerve, in case the man is
loose over that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go! Perhaps I&#8217;ll
get another crack at the scoundrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep cool. It&#8217;s ninety-nine chances in the hundred
he&#8217;s on the run and&#8217;ll keep going all week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I start now? As we came by a very roundabout
way&ndash;&ndash;We went first in the opposite direction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
and then skirted High Mesa down from the mountains.
So, you see, I may have a little difficulty&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s our wagon trail. Even
if you got off that, all you&#8217;d have to do would be to
keep headed for Split Peak. That&#8217;s right in line
with Stockchute. But you&#8217;ll not start till morning. I
haven&#8217;t got all my letters written. That&#8217;ll give you
all day to go and come. It&#8217;s only twenty-five miles
over there. Chuckie, you show this new puncher of
ours over the place, while I write those letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll start teaching him how to throw a rope,&#8221;
volunteered the girl.</p>
<p>She led the way out through a daintily furnished
front room, in which Ashton observed an upright piano
and other articles of culture that he would never have
expected to come upon in this remote section. In
passing, the girl picked up a wide-brimmed lacy hat.</p>
<p>Once outside, she first took Ashton for a walk up
Plum Creek to where half a dozen men were at work
with a mowing machine and horse rakes making hay
of the rich bunch-grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy feeds all he can in winter,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;The spring when I first came back from Denver I
cried so over the starving cattle that he promised to
always afterwards cut and stack all the hay he could.
And he has found it pays to feed well. We would put
a lot of land into oats, but, as you see, there&#8217;s not
enough water in the creek.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where an irrigation system would come
in,&#8221; remarked Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you don&#8217;t think it possible to water
our mesa!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I told you how it would
break up our range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you, I don&#8217;t think at all,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not a reclamation engineer&ndash;&ndash;never specialized
on hydraulics.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed an odd look at him. &#8220;You never?
But Mr. Blake&ndash;&ndash;that wonderful engineer of the
Zariba Dam&ndash;&ndash;he would know, wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;suppose he would&ndash;&ndash;that is, if he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Ashton
hesitated, and exclaimed, &#8220;But that&#8217;s just it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to&ndash;&ndash;to have him come here. He&#8217;s the
luckiest for blundering on ways to do things,&#8221; muttered
Ashton. He added with growing bitterness:
&#8220;Yes, if there&#8217;s any way at all to do it, you&#8217;d have
him flooding your whole range&ndash;&ndash;deluging it. He&#8217;s
got all those millions to back him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not like him,&#8221; said the girl. She looked
off towards High Mesa, her face glowing with suppressed
excitement. &#8220;No doubt you are right&ndash;&ndash;as
to his ability. But&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you see?&ndash;&ndash;if it can be
done, it is bound to be done sooner or later. All the
time Daddy and I&ndash;&ndash;and Kid, too&ndash;&ndash;are living under
this constant dread that it may be possible. But if
such an engineer as&ndash;&ndash;as Mr. Blake came and looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
over the situation and told us we needn&#8217;t fear&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
you see how&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; Ashton, in turn,
left his question unfinished and averted his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it will be best to
put an end to this uncertainty. So I believe I shall
send for&ndash;&ndash;for Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;why for&ndash;&ndash;for him&ndash;&ndash;in particular?&#8221; he
stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you dislike him,&#8221; she said, regaining
her composure when she saw that he too was agitated.</p>
<p>He did not reply. She tactfully changed the subject.
By the time they had circled around, back to the half
open feed-sheds, he was gayly chatting with her on
music and the drama. When they came down to the
horse corral she proceeded to lecture him on the duties
of a cowboy and showed him how to hold and throw
a rope. Under her skillful tuition, he at last learned
the knack of casting an open noose.</p>
<p>Evening was near when they returned to the house.
As before, they caught Knowles in the front porch contentedly
puffing at his pipe. He dropped it down out
of sight. The girl shook her finger at him, nodded to
Ashton, and went indoors. Immediately the cowman
put his pipe back into his mouth and drew another from
his pocket, together with an unopened sack of tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smoke?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s eyes gleamed. In the girl&#8217;s presence he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
had been able to restrain the fierce craving that had
tortured him since dinner. Now it so overmastered
him that he almost snatched the pipe and tobacco out
of the cowman&#8217;s hand. The latter gravely shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it that bad, have you?&#8221; he deplored.</p>
<p>Ashton could not answer until his pipe was well under
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m breaking off,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
had a cigarette all day&ndash;&ndash;nor anything else. A-ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you like it,&#8221; said Knowles. &#8220;A pipe is all
right with this kind of tobacco. You can&#8217;t inhale it
like you can cigarettes, unless you want to strangle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall break off entirely as soon as I can,&#8221; asserted
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; considered Knowles, &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying you
can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s mighty curious what a young fellow
can do to please a pretty girl. Just the same, I&#8217;d
say from the color of Kid&#8217;s fingers that he hasn&#8217;t forgotten
how to roll a fat Mexican <i>cigaretto</i>.&ndash;&ndash;Hello!
&#8216;Talk of the devil&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; Here he comes now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan came around the corner of the house, his
spurs jingling. His eyes were as cold and his face as
emotionless as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Knowles. &#8220;Have a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t get him,&#8221; reported Gowan, dropping into
a chair. &#8220;Near as I could make out, he cut straight
across for the railroad, on the jump.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it must have been that guide!&#8221; exclaimed
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks that way,&#8221; added Knowles. &#8220;Glad of it.
We won&#8217;t see him again, unless you want to notify the
sheriff, when you ride over tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, oh, no. I am satisfied to be rid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he don&#8217;t come back,&#8221; remarked Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t,&#8221; predicted Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not for a time maybe,&#8221; agreed Gowan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A MAN&#8217;S SIZE HORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>At dusk the sonorous boom of a Japanese gong
gave warning of the approach of the supper hour.
A few minutes later a second booming summoned all
in to the meal. Miss Isobel sat at one end of the
table; her father at the other. Along the sides were
the employ&eacute;s, Ashton and Gowan at the corners nearest
the girl. A large coal oil lamp with an artistic
shade cast a pink light on the clean white oilcloth of
the table and the simple tasteful table service.</p>
<p>Yuki, the silent Jap, served all with strict impartiality,
starting with the mistress of the house and going
around the table in regular succession, either one way
or the other. The six rough-appearing haymakers
used their knives with a freedom to which Ashton was
unaccustomed, but their faces were clean, their behavior
quiet, and their occasional remarks by no means
inapt.</p>
<p>After the meal they wished Miss Knowles a pleasant
&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; and left for the bunkhouse. But Ashton
and Gowan, at the smiling invitation of the girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
followed her into the front room. Knowles came in
a few minutes later and, with scarcely a glance at the
young people, settled down beside a tableful of periodicals
and magazines to study the latest Government report
on the reclamation service.</p>
<p>Ashton had entered the &#8220;parlor&#8221; under the impression
that here he would have Gowan at a disadvantage.
To his surprise, the puncher proved to be quite at
ease; his manners were correct and his conversation by
no means provincial. A moment&#8217;s reflection showed
Ashton that this could not well be otherwise, in view
of the young fellow&#8217;s intimacy with Miss Chuckie Isobel.</p>
<p>Another surprise was the discovery that Gowan had
a remarkably good ear for music and knew even more
than the girl about the masters and their works.
There was a player attachment to the piano, and the
girl and Gowan had a contest, playing the same selections
in turn, to see which could get the most expression
by means of the mechanical apparatus. If anything,
the girl came out second best. At least she said so; but
Ashton would not admit it.</p>
<p>Between times the three chatted on a thousand and
one topics, the girl always ready to bubble over with
animation and merriment. She bestowed her dimpled
smiles on both her admirers with strict impartiality and
as impartially stimulated each to his best with her
tact and gay wit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock sharp Knowles closed his report and
rose from his comfortable seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to turn in, boys. Coal oil costs more than
sunlight,&#8221; he announced, in the flat tone of a standing
joke. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take a jog down creek to the Bar-Lazy-J
ranch, first thing tomorrow, Kid.&ndash;&ndash;Ashton,
you&#8217;d better start off in the cool, before sunup.
Here&#8217;s my bunch of letters, case I might forget them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He handed over half a dozen thinly padded envelopes.
Gowan was already at the door, hat in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. Knowles. Good night, Miss
Chuckie. Pleasant dreams!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same to you, Kid!&#8221; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I give and receive the same?&#8221; asked Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But wait a moment,
please. I&#8217;ve some letters to go, myself, if you&#8217;ll
kindly take them with Daddy&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she darted into a side room, Knowles stepped
out after Gowan. When the girl returned, Ashton
took the letters that she held out to him and deliberately
started to tie them in a packet with those
of her father. His sole purpose was to prolong his
stay to the last possible moment. But inadvertently
his eye caught the name &#8220;Blake&#8221; on one of the envelopes.
His smile vanished; his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Ashton, what is the matter?&#8221; said
the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I did not
realize that&ndash;&ndash;But it&#8217;s too absurd&ndash;&ndash;it can&#8217;t be!
You did not mean what you said this afternoon. It
can&#8217;t be you&#8217;re writing to that man to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;you must not. He&#8217;s the very
devil for doing impossible things. He&#8217;ll be sure to
turn loose a flood on you&ndash;&ndash;drown you out&ndash;&ndash;destroy
your range!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it can be done, the sooner we know it the better,&#8221;
she argued. &#8220;Daddy says little, but it is becoming
a monomania with him&ndash;&ndash;the dread. I wish
to put an end to his suspense. Besides, if&ndash;&ndash;if this
Mr. Blake is as remarkable as you and the reports say
he is, it will be interesting to meet him. My only
fear is that so great an engineer will not think it worth
while to come to this out-of-the-way section.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The big four-flusher!&#8221; muttered Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you must dislike him! It makes me all the
more curious to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your father know about this letter?&#8221; queried
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget yourself, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Meeting her level gaze, he flushed crimson with
mortification. He stood biting his lip, unable to
speak.</p>
<p>She went on coldly: &#8220;I do not ask you to tell me
the cause of your hatred for Mr. Blake. I assume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
that you are a gentleman and will not destroy my letter.
But even if you should do so, it would mean only
a short delay. I shall write him again if I receive no
reply to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s flush deepened. &#8220;I did not think you could
be so hard. But&ndash;&ndash;I presume I deserved it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did,&#8221; she agreed, with no lessening of
her coldness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you will not accept an apology, Miss
Knowles. However, I give you my word that I will
deliver your letter to the postmaster at Stockchute.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started out, very stiff and erect. As he passed
through the doorway she suddenly relented and called
after him: &#8220;Good night, Mr. Ashton! Pleasant
dreams!&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled and would have stepped back to reply
had not Knowles spoken to him from the darkness at
the end of the porch: &#8220;This way, Ashton. Kid is
waiting to show you to the bunkhouse. You&#8217;ll find
a clean bunk and new blankets. I&#8217;ve also issued you
corduroy pants and a pair of leather chaps from the
commissary. Those city riding togs aren&#8217;t hardly the
thing on the range. There&#8217;s a spare saddle, if you
want to change off from yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the other things; but I prefer my
own saddle,&#8221; replied Ashton.</p>
<p>He now perceived the dim form of Gowan starting
off in the starlight, and followed him to the bunkhouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
The other men were already in their beds,
fast asleep and half of them snoring. Gowan silently
lit a lantern and showed the tenderfoot to an unoccupied
bunk in the far corner of the rough but clean
building. After a curt request for Ashton to blow out
the lantern when through with the light, he withdrew,
to tumble into a bunk near the door.</p>
<p>Ashton removed twice as many garments as had the
puncher, and slipped in between his fresh new blankets,
after several minutes spent in finding out how to
extinguish the lantern. For some time he lay listening.
He had often read of the practical jokes that
cowboys are supposed always to play on tenderfeet.
But the steady concert of the snoring sleepers was unbroken
by any horseplay. Presently he, too, fell
asleep.</p>
<p>He was wakened by a general stir in the bunkhouse.
Day had not yet come, but by the light of a lantern
near the door he could see his fellow employ&eacute;s passing
out. He dressed as hastily as he could in his
gloomy corner, putting on his new trousers and the
stiff leather chapareras in place of his breeches and
leggings. Gowan came in, glanced at him with a
trace of surprise, and went out with the lantern.</p>
<p>Ashton followed to the house and around into the
side porch. The other men were making their morning
toilets by lantern light, each drying face and hands
on his own towel. Ashton and Gowan waited their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
turn at the basins, and together went into the lamplit
dining-room, where the Jap cook was serving bacon,
coffee, and hot bread. Ashton lingered over his meal,
hoping to see Miss Isobel. But neither she nor her
father appeared.</p>
<p>Gowan had gone out with the other men. Presently
he came back to the side door and remarked in
almost a friendly tone: &#8220;Your hawss is ready whenever
you are, Ashton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Ashton, rising. &#8220;The poor old
brute must be rather stiff after the spurring I gave him
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan did not reply. He had gone out again.
Somewhat nettled, Ashton hastened after him.
Dawn had come. The gray light in the east was
brightening to an exquisite pink. The clear twilight
showed the puncher waiting at the front of the house
beside a saddled horse. A glance showed Ashton that
the saddle and bridle were his own, but that the horse
was a big, rawboned beast.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not my pony,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here Rocket hawss ain&#8217;t <i>any</i> pony,&#8221; agreed
Gowan. &#8220;He&#8217;s a man&#8217;s size hawss. Ain&#8217;t afraid
you&#8217;ll drop too far when you fall off, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to get me on a bucking bronco!&#8221;
said Ashton, suspiciously eying the bony, wild-eyed
brute.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no outlaw,&#8221; reassured Gowan. &#8220;Most all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
our hawsses are liable to prance some when they&#8217;ve
et too many rattlers. But Miss Chuckie said you can
ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said Ashton, tightening the thong of his
sombrero down across the back of his head and buttoning
his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roped this Rocket hawss for you because Mr.
Knowles wants his mail by sundown,&#8221; remarked
Gowan. &#8220;He shore can travel some when he feels
like it. Don&#8217;t know as you&#8217;ll need your spurs.
Here&#8217;s a five-spot Mr. Knowles said to hand you by
way of advance. Thought you might want to refresh
yourself over at Stockchute. Wouldn&#8217;t rather have
another saddle and bridle, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly thank Mr. Knowles for me,&#8221; said Ashton,
pocketing the five dollar bill. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;the horse is
hard-mouthed, but I prefer my own saddle and bridle.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew his rifle from its sheath, wiped the dew
from the butt, and tested the mechanism. The horse
cocked his ears, but stood motionless while the rifle
was taken out and replaced. Ashton picked up the
reins from the ground and threw them over the horse&#8217;s
head. The beast did not swing around, but his ewe
neck straightened and his entire body stiffened to a
peculiar rigidity.</p>
<p>Ashton tested the tightness of his saddle girth, and
paused to gaze at the closed front door of the house.
Aside from his saddle and burlesque sombrero, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
looked every inch a puncher, both in dress and in bearing.
But Miss Isobel missed the effect of his new
<i>ensemble</i>. She missed also the interesting spectacle
of his mounting.</p>
<p>If he had never ridden a cow pony he would have
been thrown and dragged the instant he put his foot in
the narrow metal stirrup. The horse was watching
him alertly, every muscle tense. Ashton smiled confidently,
spoke to the beast in a quiet tone, and pulled
on the off rein. The horse bent his head to the pull,
for the moment off his guard. In a twinkling Ashton
had his foot in the stirrup and was up in the saddle.
His toe slipped into the other stirrup as the horse
jumped sideways.</p>
<p>The leap was tremendous, but it failed to unseat
Ashton. It was instantly followed by other wild
jumps&ndash;&ndash;whirling forward and sidelong leaps, interspersed
with frantic plunging and rearing. Gowan
looked on, agape with amazement. The tenderfoot
stuck fast on his flat little saddle and only once pulled
leather. Rocket was not a star bucker, but he had
thrown more than one half-baked cowboy.</p>
<p>Finding that he could not unseat his rider, the beast
suddenly gave over his plunging, and bolted at furious
speed down the smooth slope towards Plum Creek.
Before they had gone half a furlong Ashton realized
that he was on a blooded horse of unusual speed and
a runaway. He could not hope to pull down so tough-mouthed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
a beast with his ordinary curb. The best he
could do was to throw all his weight on the right rein.
Unable altogether to resist the steady tug at his head,
the racing horse gradually swerved until he was
headed across the mesa towards the jagged, snow-streaked
twin crests of Split Peak.</p>
<p>Horse and rider were still in the curve of their swift
flight when Isobel Knowles came out into the porch,
yawning behind her plump, sunbrowned hand. A
glance at Gowan cut the yawn short. She looked
alertly afield and at once caught sight of the runaway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid!&ndash;&ndash;O-oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Mr. Ashton!&ndash;&ndash;on
Rocket!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan spun about to her with a guilty start, but
answered almost glibly: &#8220;You said he could ride,
Miss Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll be killed!&ndash;&ndash;Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles stepped out through the doorway, cocking
his big blue-barreled Colt&#8217;s. Gowan hastily
pointed towards the runaway. Knowles looked, and
dropped the revolver to his side. &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he
growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;he put Mr. Ashton on Rocket!&#8221;
breathlessly answered his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to contradict you, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; said
Gowan. &#8220;He put himself on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on yet,&#8221; dryly commented the cowman.
&#8220;May be something to that boy, after all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, Daddy!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, just stop fussing yourself, honey. He and
Rocket are going smooth as axlegrease and bee-lining
for Stockchute. How did the hawss start off?&ndash;&ndash;skittish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to make the tenderfoot pull leather,&#8221;
said Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he stuck at all, with that fool saddle&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; rejoined
Knowles. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, honey. He sure
can fork a hawss&ndash;&ndash;that tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; the girl sighed with relief. &#8220;If Rocket
started off bucking, and he kept his seat, of course it&#8217;s
all right. See him take that gully!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure gave me a start, honey, calling out that
way.&ndash;&ndash;Well, Kid, it&#8217;s about time we were off. I&#8217;ll
get my hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan stepped nearer the girl as her father went
inside. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to the tenderfoot to tell you,
Miss Chuckie. He&#8217;ll have to own up I gave him fair
warning. Told him he wouldn&#8217;t need his spurs, and
asked if he&#8217;d have another bit and saddle; but it
wasn&#8217;t any use. He&#8217;s the kind that won&#8217;t take advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you meant it as a joke, Kid. You did not
realize the danger of his narrow stirrups. Had he
been caught in mounting or had he been thrown, he
would almost certainly have been dragged. And for
you to give him our one ugly hawss!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said he could ride,&#8221; the puncher defended
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive you for your joke&ndash;&ndash;if he comes back
safe,&#8221; she qualified, without turning her gaze from the
now distant horse and rider.</p>
<p>Gowan started for the corral, the slight waddle of
his bowlegged gait rather more pronounced than
usual. When Knowles came out with his hat, the runaway
was well up on the divide towards Dry Fork.
Rocket was justifying his name.</p>
<p>In a few seconds the flying horse and rider had
disappeared down the far slope. The girl followed
her father and Gowan to the corral, and after they had
ridden off, she roped and saddled one of the three
horses in the corral. She mounted and was off on the
jump, riding straight for the nearest point on the
summit of the divide.</p>
<p>As, presently, she came up towards the top of the
rise, she gazed anxiously ahead towards Dry Fork.
Before she could see over the bend down to the creek
channel, she caught sight of a cloud of dust far out on
the mesa beyond the stream. She smiled with relief
and wheeled about to return. The tenderfoot had
safely crossed the stream bed. He would have Rocket
well in hand before they came to rough country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE SNAKE</h3>
</div>
<p>Early in the afternoon, having nothing else to do,
Isobel again saddled up and started off towards
Dry Fork. Her intention was to ride out on the road
to Stockchute and meet Ashton, if he was not too
late.</p>
<p>As she rode up one side of the divide, a hat appeared
over the bend of the other side. She could
not mistake the high peak of that comic opera sombrero.
Ashton was almost back to the ranch. Her
first thought was that he had gone part way, and
given up the trip. The big sombrero bobbed up and
down in an odd manner. She guessed the cause even
before Ashton&#8217;s head and body appeared, rising and
falling rhythmically. She stared as Rocket swept up
into view, covering the ground with a long-strided
trot.</p>
<p>Ashton waved to her. She waved back. A few
moments later they were close together. As she spun
her pony around, he pulled in his horse to a walk, patting
the beast&#8217;s neck and speaking to him caressingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back already?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Surely, you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
not been to Stockchute&ndash;&ndash;Yes, you have!&#8221; Her
experienced eye was taking in every indication of his
horse&#8217;s condition. &#8220;He&#8217;s been traveling; but you&#8217;ve
handled him well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s grand!&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;Been putting him
through his paces. I suppose he is your father&#8217;s best
mount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy and Kid ride him when they&#8217;re in a hurry
or there&#8217;s no other horse handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean&ndash;&ndash;? Then perhaps I can have
him again occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You like him, really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All he needs is a little management,&#8221; replied Ashton,
again patting the horse&#8217;s lean neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish to take him in hand, I&#8217;ll assign him to
you. No one else wants him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As your rural deliveryman&#8217;s mount&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began
Ashton. He stopped to show the bulging bag slung
under his arm. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the mail. Do you wish
your letters now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is this, however,&#8221; he said, handing her a
folded slip of paper.</p>
<p>She opened it and looked at the writing inside. It
was a receipt from the postmaster at Stockchute to
Lafayette Ashton for certain letters delivered for
mailing. The address of the letter to Thomas Blake
was given in full. The girl colored, bit her lip, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
murmured contritely: &#8220;You have turned the tables
on me. I deserved it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take it that way!&#8221; he begged. &#8220;My
purpose was merely to assure you the letter was
mailed. After all, I am a stranger, Miss Knowles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not now,&#8221; she differed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of you to say it! Yet it&#8217;s just as
well for me to start off with no doubts in your mind,
in view of the fact that in two or three weeks&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she asked, as he hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;Your father will hardly keep me more than
two weeks, unless&ndash;&ndash;unless I make good,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you needn&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; she replied,
somewhat ambiguously.</p>
<p>He shrugged. &#8220;It is very good of you to say it,
Miss Knowles. I know I shall fail. Can you expect
anyone who has always lived within touch of millions,
one who has spent more in four years at college
than all this range is worth&ndash;&ndash;He cut my allowance
repeatedly, until it was only a beggarly twenty-five
thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five thousand dollars!&#8221; exclaimed Isobel.
&#8220;You had all that to&ndash;&ndash;to throw away in a single
year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cut me down to it the last year&ndash;&ndash;a mere
bagatelle to what I had all the time I was at college
and Tech.,&#8221; replied Ashton, his eyes sparkling at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
recollection. &#8220;He wished me to get in thick with
the New Yorkers, the sons of the Wall Street leaders.
He gave me leave to draw on him without limit. I
did what he wished me to do,&ndash;&ndash;I got in with the
most exclusive set. Ah-h!&ndash;&ndash;the way I made the
dollars fly! Before I graduated I was the acknowledged
leader. What&#8217;s more, I led my class, too&ndash;&ndash;when
I chose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you chose!&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;And now what
are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question punctured his reminiscent elation.
He sagged down in his saddle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he
answered despondently. &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> To come
down to this&ndash;&ndash;a common laborer for wages&ndash;&ndash;after
<i>that</i>! When I think of it&ndash;&ndash;when I think of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not to think of it again!&#8221; she commanded
with kindly severity. &#8220;What you are to remember
all the time is that you are now a man and honestly
earning your own living, and no longer a&ndash;&ndash;a leech
battening on the sustenance produced by others.&#8221;</p>
<p>He winced. &#8220;Was that my fault?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was your father&#8217;s. I marvel that he did
not utterly ruin you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has! In his last will he cuts me off with only
a dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was it?&ndash;&ndash;And you think that ruined you?
I say it saved you!&#8221; she went on with the same kindly
severity. &#8220;You were a parasite. Now the chance is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
yours to prove that you have the makings of a man.
You have started to prove it. You shall not stop
proving it. You are not going to be a quitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he declared, straightening under her bright
gaze. &#8220;I will not quit. I will try my best to make
good as long as the chance is given me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking!&#8221; she commended him
breezily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I do otherwise when you asked me?&#8221;
he replied with a grave sincerity far more complimentary
than mere gallantry.</p>
<p>She colored with pleasure and began to tell him of
the cattle and their ways.</p>
<p>When they reached the corral she complimented him
in turn by allowing him to offsaddle her horse. They
walked on down to the house and seated themselves
in the porch. As he opened the bag of mail for her
she noticed that her hand was empty and turned to
look back towards the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your receipt from the postmaster,&#8221; she remarked;
&#8220;I must have dropped it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang up. &#8220;If you wish to keep it, I shall
go back and find it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, oh, no; unless you want it yourself,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. The matter is closed, thanks to your kindness,&#8221;
he declared, again seating himself.</p>
<p>He was right, in so far as they were concerned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Yet the matter was not closed. That evening, when
Knowles and Gowan returned from their day of range
riding, the younger man noticed a crumpled slip of
paper lying against the foot of the corral post below
the place where he tossed up his saddle. He picked
it up and looked to see if it was of any value. An
oath burst from his thin-drawn lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Kid!&#8221; remonstrated Knowles. &#8220;I&#8217;m no
more squeamish than most, but you know I don&#8217;t like
any cussing so near Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this!&#8221; cried Gowan&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Enough to make
anybody cuss!&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust out the slip of paper close before his employer&#8217;s
eyes. Knowles took it and read it through
with deliberate care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a receipt from the postmaster
to Ashton for those letters I sent over by him.
What of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Your</i> letters?&#8221; asked Gowan, taken aback.
&#8220;Did you write that one what is most particularly
mentioned, the one to that big engineer Blake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What would I be doing, writing to him or
any engineer? They&#8217;re just the people I don&#8217;t want
to have any doings with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you didn&#8217;t write him, who did?&#8221; questioned
Gowan, his mouth again tightening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon you&#8217;ll have to do your own guessing,
Kid&ndash;&ndash;unless it might be Ashton did it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one leg roped,&#8221; said Gowan. &#8220;Can you
guess why he&#8217;d be writing to that engineer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no. He may have the luck to know him.
Mr. Blake is a mighty big man, judging from all accounts;
but money stands for a lot in the cities and
back East, and Ashton&#8217;s father is one of the richest
men in Chicago. I looked it up in the magazine that
told about his helping to back the Zariba Dam project.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another leg noosed&ndash;&ndash;on the second
throw,&#8221; said Gowan. &#8220;Another try or two, and we&#8217;ll
have the skunk ready for hog-tying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed the cowman. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got something up your sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s that striped skunk that&#8217;s doing the
crooked playing,&#8221; snapped Gowan. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
savvy his game? It&#8217;s all a frame-up&ndash;&ndash;his sending
off his guide and outfit, so&#8217;s to let on to you he&#8217;d been
busted up and kicked out by his dad. You take him in
to keep his pretty carcass from the coyotes&ndash;&ndash;which
has saved them from being poisoned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Kid, only trouble about you
you&#8217;re too apt to go off at half-cock. This young fellow
may not be&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shore is a snake, Mr. Knowles, and this receipt
proves it on him,&#8221; broke in the puncher. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
you taken him into your employ?&ndash;&ndash;ain&#8217;t you treated
him like he was a man?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;tisn&#8217;t every busted millionaire would have
asked for work, and he seems to mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a bluff! You don&#8217;t savvy the game yet.
Busted millionaire&ndash;&ndash;<i>bah!</i> He&#8217;s the coyote of that
bunch of reclamation wolves. He comes out here to
sneak around and get the lay of things. We happen
to catch him rustling. To save his cussed carcass, he
lets out about who his dad is. Course he couldn&#8217;t
know we&#8217;d got all the reports on that Zariba Dam
and who backed the engineer, nor that we&#8217;d know all
about Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Knowles, frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he works us for suckers,&ndash;&ndash;worms in here with
us where he can learn all about you and your holdings;
ropes a job with you, and gets off his report to
that engineer Blake, first time he rides over to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all your argument?&#8221; asked Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it enough?&#8221; rejoined Gowan. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t he
and that bunch all in cahoots together? Ain&#8217;t this
sneaking cuss&#8217;s dad either the partner or the boss of
Blake? Ain&#8217;t Blake engaged in reclamation projects?
You shore see all that. What follows?&ndash;&ndash;It&#8217;s all a
frame-up, I tell you. Young Ashton comes out here
as a sort of forerider for his concern; finds out what
his people want to know, and now he&#8217;s sent in his report
to Blake. Next thing happens, Blake&#8217;ll be
turning up with a surveying outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles scratched his head. &#8220;Hum-m-m&ndash;&ndash;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
sure put up a mighty stiff argument, Kid. I&#8217;m not so
sure, though.... Um-m-m&ndash;&ndash;Strikes me some of
your knots might be tighter. First place, there wasn&#8217;t
any play-acting about the way the boy went plumb to
pieces there at the waterhole. Next place, a man like
his father, that&#8217;s piled up a mint of money, isn&#8217;t
going to send out his son as forerider in a hostile
country. Lastly, I&#8217;ve read a lot more about that
engineer Blake than you have, and I&#8217;ve sized him up
as a man who won&#8217;t do anything that isn&#8217;t square and
open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he ain&#8217;t in on the dirty side of the deal,&#8221;
admitted Gowan. &#8220;How about this letter, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a friendly writing, like as not,&#8221; answered the
cowman. &#8220;No, Kid&ndash;&ndash;only trouble with you is
you&#8217;re too anxious over the interests of Dry Mesa
range. I appreciate it, boy, and so does Chuckie.
But that&#8217;s no reason for you to take every newcomer
for a wolf &#8217;til he proves he&#8217;s only a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t do anything?&#8221; asked the puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire him&ndash;&ndash;run him off Dry Mesa,&#8221; snapped
Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t oblige you, Kid,&#8221; replied Knowles.
&#8220;You mean well, but you&#8217;ll have to make a better
showing before I&#8217;ll turn adrift any man that seems to
be trying to make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan looked down. After a brief pause he replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
with unexpected submissiveness: &#8220;All right,
Mr. Knowles. You&#8217;re the boss. Reckon you know
best. I don&#8217;t savvy these city folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you admit it,&#8221; said Knowles. &#8220;You&#8217;re all
wrong in sizing him up that way. I&#8217;ve a notion he&#8217;s
got a lot of good in him, spite of his city rearing. I
wouldn&#8217;t object, though, if you wanted to test him out
with a little harmless hazing, long as you didn&#8217;t go
too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declined Gowan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my own notion
of what he is. There&#8217;s just one way to deal
with skunks, and that is, don&#8217;t fool with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowman accepted this as conclusive. But
when, a little later, Ashton met Gowan at the supper
table he was rendered uneasy by the cold glint in the
puncher&#8217;s gray eyes. As nothing was said about the
postmaster&#8217;s receipt, he could conjecture no reason for
the look other than that Gowan was planning to render
him ridiculous with some cowboy trick.</p>
<p>Isobel had assured him with utmost confidence that
the testing of his horsemanship by means of Rocket
had been intended only as a practical joke, and that
Gowan would never have permitted him to mount the
horse had he considered it at all dangerous. Yet the
fellow might next undertake jokes containing no element
of physical peril and consequently all the more
humiliating unless evaded.</p>
<p>In apprehension of this, the tenderfoot lay awake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
most of that night and fully half of the next. His
watch was fruitless. Each night Gowan and the other
men left him strictly alone in his far dark corner of
the bunkhouse. In the daytime the puncher was
studiously polite to him during the few hours that he
was not off on the range.</p>
<p>The third evening, after supper, Gowan handed
Isobel the horny, half-flattened rattles of an unusually
large rattlesnake.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? Do you wish me to guess his
length?&#8221; she asked, evidently surprised that he should
fetch her so commonplace an object. &#8220;I make it four
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re three inches short,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;only I just happened to get him up
near the bunkhouse, Miss Chuckie. Thought I&#8217;d tell
you, in case he has a mate around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must all look sharp. You, too, Mr. Ashton.
They are more apt to strike without warning, this time
of year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; remarked Ashton. &#8220;It&#8217;s before they
cast their old skin, and it makes them blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too early for that,&#8221; corrected Knowles. &#8220;I
figure it&#8217;s the long spell of the summer&#8217;s heat. Gets
on their nerves, same as with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They shore are mighty like some humans,&#8221; observed
Gowan. &#8220;Look at the way they like to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
snuggle up in your blankets on a cool night. Remember
how I used to carry a hair rope on spring round-up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that they used to crawl into the bunkhouse
before the floor was laid,&#8221; said Isobel. She
smiled at Ashton. &#8220;That was the Dry Mesa reptilian
age. I first learned to handle a &#8216;gun&#8217; shooting
at rattlers. There were so many we had to make it
a rule to kill everyone we could. But there hasn&#8217;t
been one killed so near the house for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They often go in pairs. This one, though, may
have been a lone stray,&#8221; added Gowan. He looked
at his employer. &#8220;Talking about strays, guess I&#8217;d
best go out in the morning and head back that Bar-Lazy-J
bunch. I can take an iron along and brand
those two calves, same trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles nodded and returned to his Government
report. The two young men and Isobel began an
evening&#8217;s entertainment at the piano. Ashton enjoyed
himself immensely. Though so frank and unconstrained
in manner, the girl was as truly refined as
the most fastidiously reared ladies of the East.</p>
<p>At the end of the delightful evening he withdrew
with Gowan to the bunkhouse, reluctant to leave, yet
aglow with pleasure. Isobel had so charmed him
that he lay in his bunk forgetful of all else than her
limpid blue eyes and dimpled cheeks. But after his
two nights of broken rest he could not long resist the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
heaviness that pressed together his eyelids. He fell
asleep, smiling at the recollection of the girl&#8217;s gracious,
&#8220;Good-night and pleasant dreams!&#8221;</p>
<p>With such a kindly wish from her, his dreams certainly
should have been heavenly. Yet he began the
night by sinking into so profound a sleep that he had
no dreams whatever. When at last he did rouse to
the dream-state of consciousness, it was not to enjoy
any pleasant fantasy of music and flowers.</p>
<p>He was lying in Deep Ca&ntilde;on, down at the very bottom
of those gloomy depths. About him was an
awful stillness. The river of the abyss was no longer
roaring. It had risen up, up, up to the very rim of
the precipices&ndash;&ndash;and all the tremendous weight of its
waters was above him, bearing down upon him,
smothering him, crushing in his chest! He sought to
shriek, and found himself dumb.</p>
<p>Suddenly an Indian stood over him, a gigantic Indian
with feet set upon his breast. The red giant was
a medicine man, for he clashed and rattled an enormous
gourd full of bowlders.</p>
<p>The rattle sounded sharper, shriller, more vibrant
in the ears of the rousing sleeper. His eyelids fluttered,
rose a little way, and snapped wide apart. His
eyes, bared of their covers, glared in utter horror of
that which they saw. Their pupils dilated, their balls
bulged as if about to burst from the sockets.</p>
<p>The weight was still on his chest,&ndash;&ndash;a weight far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
more to be dreaded than a ca&ntilde;on full of water or the
foot of an Indian Titan. It was a weight of living,
quivering coils. Above those coils, clearly illuminated
in the full daylight that streamed through the
open door of the bunkhouse, there upreared a hideous
gaping maw, set with four slender curved fangs of
dazzling whiteness.</p>
<p>The snake&#8217;s eyes, green as emeralds, glared down
into the face of the man with such intense malignancy
that they seemed to stream forth a cold evil light.
Fortunately he was paralyzed with fright. The
slightest movement would have caused that fanged
maw to lash down into his face.</p>
<p>Something partly obscured the light in the doorway.
Ashton was too terrified to heed. But the snake was
more sensitive to the change in the light. Without
altering the deadly poise of its head, it again sounded
its shrill, menacing rattle. The shadow passed and
the light streamed in as before. The rattling ceased.
There followed a pause of a few seconds&#8217; duration&ndash;&ndash;To
the man every second was an age-long period of
horror.</p>
<p>A faint metallic click came from across the room.
Slight as was the sound, the irritated snake again set
its rattle to quivering. The triangular head flattened
back for the delayed stroke at the ashen face of the
man. The billowing coils stiffened&ndash;&ndash;the stroke
started. In the same instant came a report that to the
strained ears of the man sounded like the crashing
roar of a cannon.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/depths-002.jpg' alt='' title='' width='411' height='610' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
It sounded its shrill, menacing rattle<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>The head and forepart of the snake&#8217;s body shot
alongside his face, writhing in swift convulsions. The
first touch of its cold scales against his cheek broke the
spell of horror that had bound him. He jerked his
head aside, and flung out his left hand to push the
hideous thing from him. As his fingers thrust away
the nearest coil, the head flipped around on its half-severed
neck, and the deadly jaws automatically gaped
and snapped together. Two of the dripping poison
fangs struck in the cushion of flesh on the outer edge
of Ashton&#8217;s hand. With a shriek, he flung the dying
snake on the floor and put the wounded hand to his
mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;He struck you!&#8221; cried the voice of Isobel, &#8220;but
only on the hand, thank goodness! Wait, I&#8217;ll fix it.
Lie still.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came swiftly across the room, thrusting a long-barreled
automatic pistol into its holster under a fold
of her skirt. Her other hand drew out a locket that
was suspended in her bosom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiskey! I&#8217;m bitten!&#8221; panted Ashton, sucking
frantically at his wounds. &#8220;Quick! I&#8217;m bitten.
Give me whiskey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, steady,&#8221; she reassured. &#8220;It&#8217;s not bad&ndash;&ndash;only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
on your hand. Give it to me. Here&#8217;s something
a thousand times better than whiskey&ndash;&ndash;permanganate.&#8221;</p>
<p>While speaking, she caught up his neckerchief from
the head of the bunk and knotted it about the wrist
of the wounded hand tightly enough to check the circulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now hold it steady,&#8221; she directed. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
have to use a knife. You tore open the holes when
you jerked off the horrid thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obedient but still sweating with fear, he held up
the bleeding hand. She had opened her locket, in
which were a number of small, dark-purple crystals.
Two of the larger ones she thrust lengthwise as
deeply as she could into the little slits gashed by the
fangs. Another large and two small crystals were
all that she could force into the openings.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she cheerily exclaimed. &#8220;That will kill
the poison in short order, and will not hurt you a particle.
It&#8217;s the best thing there is to cheat rattlers,&ndash;&ndash;just
cheap, ordinary permanganate of potash. If
people only had sense enough always to carry a few
crystals, no one would ever die of rattlesnake bites.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve heard that whiskey&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and far more victims die from the whiskey
than from the bites,&#8221; rejoined Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a stimulant&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stimulant, then heart depressant&ndash;&ndash;first up, then
down&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s alcohol. No, you&#8217;ll get only one
poison, the snake&#8217;s, this time. So don&#8217;t worry.
You&#8217;ll soon be all right. Even had you been struck
in the face, quick action with permanganate would
have saved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shuddered. &#8220;Ah!... But if you had not
come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fortunate, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I
did not know you were in here. I was going up to
the corral and heard the rattle as I came past. It was
so faint that I might not have noticed it, had not Kid
told of killing the rattler yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared fearfully at his blackening hand.
Isobel smiled and began to unknot the neckerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to fear,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;That
is due only to lack of circulation. You&#8217;ll soon be
all right. Come up to the house as soon as you can
and get two or three cups of coffee. I&#8217;ll tell Yuki.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hastened out. When he had made sure that
the still writhing snake was far over on the floor, he
slipped from his bunk and dressed as quickly as was
possible without the use of his numbed hand. Shirt,
trousers, boots&ndash;&ndash;he stopped for no more, but hurried
after Isobel. Whether because of the effects of the
poison or merely as the reaction of the shock, he felt
faint and dizzy. Several cups of hot strong coffee,
however, went far towards restoring him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>COMING EVENTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Knowles had gone with Gowan to cut out and
drive back the stray cattle belonging to the adjoining
range. They returned during the regular
supper hour. The cowman washed quickly and hastened
in to the table. Gowan, however, loitered just
outside the door, fastening and refastening his neckerchief.
He entered the dining-room while Isobel
was in the midst of telling her father about the snake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear, Kid?&#8221; she asked, when she finished
her vivid account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Chuckie. I was slicking-up close
&#8217;longside the door. I heard all you told,&#8221; he replied
as he took his seat at the corner next to the animated
girl. &#8220;We shore have got one mighty lucky
tenderfoot on this range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes!&#8221; exclaimed Ashton. &#8220;Had not
Miss Chuckie chanced to be passing as the monster
rattled&ndash;&ndash;You know, she says that she might not
have heeded it but for your killing the other snake
yesterday. That put her on the alert.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher stared across the table at the city man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
with a coldly speculative gaze. &#8220;You shore are a
lucky tenderfoot,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t every fellow
gets that close to a rattler this time of year and
comes out of it as easy as you have. All I can see
is you&#8217;re kind of pale yet around the gills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton held up his bandaged left hand. &#8220;Ah, but
I have also this memento of the occasion. It is far
from a pleasant one, I assure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feels &#8217;most as bad as a bee sting, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;
ironically condoled the puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can&#8217;t make out,&#8221; interposed Knowles, &#8220;is
how that rattler got up into Mr. Ashton&#8217;s bunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan again stared across at the tenderfoot, this
time with unblinking solemnity. &#8220;Can&#8217;t say, Mr.
Knowles,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Except it might be that desperado
guide of his came around in the night and
brought him Mr. Rattler for bedfellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kid!&#8221; remonstrated Isobel. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a
joking matter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re dead right, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; he agreed.
&#8220;There shore ain&#8217;t any joke about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but perhaps I can make one,&#8221; gayly dissented
Ashton. &#8220;Had you not interfered, Miss Chuckie, the
poor snake would have taken one bite, and then curled
up and died. I&#8217;m so charged with nicotine, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Isobel nor the puncher smiled at this ancient
witticism. But Knowles burst into a hearty laugh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
which was caught up and re&euml;nforced by the hitherto
silent haymakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James! Ashton, you&#8217;ll do!&#8221; declared the
cowman, wiping his eyes. &#8220;When a tenderfoot can
let off a joke like that on himself it&#8217;s a sure sign he&#8217;s
getting acclimated. Yes, you&#8217;ll make a puncher,
some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton smiled with gratification, and looked at Isobel
in eager-eyed appeal for the confirmation of the
statement. She smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Upon his return from his remarkable ride to town
she had assured him that he need not worry. Her
present kindly look and the words of her father might
have been expected to remove his last doubts. Such
in fact was the result for the remainder of the evening.</p>
<p>But that night the new employ&eacute; must have given
much anxious thought to the question of his future and
his great need to &#8220;make good.&#8221; The liveliness of
his concern was shown by his behavior during the next
two weeks. His zeal for work astonished Knowles
quite as much as his efforts to be agreeable to his
fellow employ&eacute;s gratified Miss Isobel. He charmed
the Japanese cook with his praise of the cooking, he
flattered the haymakers with his interest in their opinions.
Towards the girl and her father he was impeccably
respectful.</p>
<p>Within ten days he was &#8220;Lafe&#8221; to everybody except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Gowan and the Jap. The latter addressed him
as &#8220;Mistah Lafe&#8221;; Gowan kept to the noncommittal
&#8220;Ashton.&#8221; The puncher had become more taciturn
than ever, but missed none of the home evenings in
the parlor. He watched Ashton with catlike closeness
when Isobel was present, and seemed puzzled that
the interloper refrained from courting her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t savvy that tenderfoot,&#8221; he remarked one
day to Knowles. &#8220;All his talk about his dad being
a multimillionaire&ndash;&ndash;Acted like it at the start-off.
Came down to this candidate-for-office way of comporting
himself. It ain&#8217;t natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when he&#8217;s on the same range with Chuckie?&#8221;
queried the cowman, his eyes twinkling. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you ever go into Stockchute and paint the town red?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; insisted Gowan. &#8220;He
started in with Miss Chuckie brash as all hell. Now
he acts towards her like I feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s natural. He soon found out she&#8217;s a
lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it ain&#8217;t natural, Mr. Knowles&ndash;&ndash;not in him,
it ain&#8217;t. Nor it ain&#8217;t natural for him to be so all-fired
polite to everybody, nor his pestering you to find
work for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not natural for a tenderfoot to gentle a
hawss like Rocket the way he&#8217;s done already,&#8221; rallied
Knowles. &#8220;That crazy hawss follows him about like
a dog.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Ashton feeds him sugar, like he does the
rest of you,&#8221; rejoined the puncher. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t natural
in his brand of tenderfoot&ndash;&ndash;Bound to ride out, if
there&#8217;s any riding to do; bound to fuss and stew
around the corral; bound to help with the haying;
bound to help haul the water; bound to practice with
his rope every moment he ain&#8217;t doing something else.
Can&#8217;t tell me there ain&#8217;t a nigger in that woodpile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t go to hunting out any more mares&#8217;
nests, Kid,&#8221; admonished Knowles. &#8220;He&#8217;s just a
busted millionaire, that&#8217;s all; and he&#8217;s proving he
realizes it. Guess the smash scared him. He&#8217;s
afraid he can&#8217;t make good. Chuckie says he thinks
I&#8217;ll turn him adrift if he doesn&#8217;t hustle enough to earn
his salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not fire him anyway? You don&#8217;t need him,
and you won&#8217;t need him,&#8221; argued the puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he helps keep Chuckie entertained. With
you and him both on the place, she might conclude to
stay over the winter, this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan&#8217;s mouth straightened to a thin slit. &#8220;Better
send her to Denver right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Kid,&#8221; reproved the cowman.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve had your chance, and you&#8217;ve got it yet.
I&#8217;ve never interfered with you, and I&#8217;m not going
to with him. It&#8217;s for Chuckie to pick the winner.
Like as not it&#8217;ll be some man in town, for all I know.
She has the say. Whether he wears a derby or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
sombrero, she&#8217;s to have her own choice. I don&#8217;t care
if he&#8217;s a millionaire or a busted millionaire or a
bronco buster, provided he&#8217;s a man, and provided
I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll treat her right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan lapsed into a sullen silence.</p>
<p>Mounted as before on Rocket, Ashton had already
made a second trip to Stockchute for mail, returning
almost as quickly as on his wild first ride. Monday
of his third week at the ranch he was sent on his third
trip. As before, he started at dawn. But this time
he did not come racing back early enough for a belated
noon meal as he had on each of the previous occasions.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon Isobel began to grow uneasy.
Remarkable as had been the efforts of his new rider&#8217;s
training, there was the not improbable chance that
Rocket had reverted to his ugly tricks. She shuddered
as she pictured the battered corpse of the city
man dragging over the rocks and through the brush,
with a foot twisted fast in one of the narrow iron
stirrups.</p>
<p>Her father and Gowan were off on their usual work
of inspecting the bunches of cattle scattered about the
range. The other men were as busy as ever mowing
more hay and hauling in that which was cured. She
was alone at the ranch with the Jap. At four o&#8217;clock
she saddled her best horse and rode out towards Dry
Fork. She hoped to sight Ashton from the divide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
But there was no sign of any horseman out on the
wide stretch of sagebrush flats.</p>
<p>She rode down to Dry Fork, crossed over the sandy
channel, and started on at a gallop along the half-beaten
road that wound away through the sagebrush
towards the distant Split Peak. An hour found her
nearing the pi&ntilde;on clad hills on the far side of Dry
Mesa, with still no sign of Ashton.</p>
<p>By this time she had worked herself into a fever
of excitement and dread. Her relief was correspondingly
great when at last she saw him coming towards
her around the bend of the nearest hill. But his
horse was walking and he was bent over in the saddle
as if injured or greatly fatigued. Puzzled and again
apprehensive, she urged her pony to sprinting speed.</p>
<p>When he heard the approaching hoofs Ashton
looked up as if startled. But he did not wave to her
or raise his sombrero. As she came racing up she
scrutinized his dejected figure for wounds or bruises.
There was nothing to indicate that he had been either
shot or thrown. His sullen look when she drew up
beside him not unnaturally changed her anxiety to
vexation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you so slow?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;You
know how eager I am for the mail each time. You
might as well have ridden your own hawss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;has come,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The letter from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him?&#8221; echoed the girl, trying hard to cover her
confusion with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>His dejection deepened as he observed her heightened
color and the light in her eyes. &#8220;Yes, from
him,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean Mr. Blake, I suppose,&#8221; she replied.
Lightly as she spoke, she could not suppress the quiver
of eagerness in her voice. &#8220;If you will kindly give it
to me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out a letter, not from among the other
mail in his pouch, but from his pocket. Her look of
surprise showed that she was struck with the oddness
of this. She was too excited, however, to consider
what might be its meaning. She tore open the letter
and read it swiftly. Her sparkling eyes and glowing
cheeks when she looked up served only to increase
Ashton&#8217;s gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the fellow is coming,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;What
else could I have expected?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl held out the open letter to him. It was in
typewriting, addressed from Chicago, and read:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><i>Dear Madam</i>:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>In reply to your letter of inquiry regarding an inspection
to determine the feasibility of irrigating certain
lands in your vicinity&ndash;&ndash;my fee for personal
inspection and opinion would be $50. per day and
expenses, if I came as consulting engineer. However,
I am about to make a trip to Colorado. If you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
furnish good ranch fare for my wife, son, and self as
guests, will look over your situation without charge.
Wife wishes to rough-it, but must have milk and eggs.
Will leave servants in car at Stockchute, where we
shall expect a conveyance to meet us Thursday, the
25th inst., if terms agreeable.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.125em;'>Respectfully yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'><span class='smcap'>Thomas Blake</span>.</span><br /></p>
<p>Ashton crumpled the letter in his clenched hand as
he had crumpled the letter from his father&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming! he really is coming!&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Thursday&ndash;&ndash;only three days! Genevieve too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And his son!&#8221; cried Isobel, too excited to heed the
dismay in her companion&#8217;s look and tone. &#8220;He and
his family, too, as my guests!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ashton bitterly. &#8220;And what of it
when he floods you off your cattle range? By another
year or two, the irrigation farmers will be settling all
over this mesa, thick as flies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it is probable that Mr. Blake will find
there is no chance to water Dry Mesa,&#8221; she replied,
in a tone strangely nonchalant considering her former
expressions of apprehension. She drew the crumpled
letter from his relaxing fingers, and smoothed it out
for a second reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wife, son, and self,&#8217;&#8221; she quoted. &#8220;Son? How
old is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;ve been married nearly two
years,&#8221; muttered Ashton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a baby!&ndash;&ndash;oh! oh! how lovely!&#8221;
shrieked the girl. &#8220;And its mamma wants to rough
it! She shall have every egg and chicken on the place&ndash;&ndash;and
gallons of cream! We shall take the skim
milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Ashton failed to enthuse. &#8220;To them that
have, shall be given, and from him who has lost millions
shall be taken all that&#8217;s left!&#8221; he gibed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll still have the skim milk,&#8221; she bantered,
refusing to notice his cynical bitterness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a day laborer!&#8221; he went on, still more bitterly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of losing even my skim milk&ndash;&ndash;And
two weeks ago I thought myself certain of three
times the millions that he will get when her father
dies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use crying over spilt milk, or spilt cream,
either!&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>The note of sympathetic concern under her raillery
brought a glimmer of hopefulness into his moody eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did not think your father will drive me
away!&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when Blake comes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Ashton paused
and shifted to a question. &#8220;Will you tell your father
about their coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I did not tell him about writing, because
it would only have increased his suspense. But
now&ndash;&ndash;Let&#8217;s hurry back!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>A cut of her quirt set her pony into a lope. Rocket
needed no urging. He followed and maintained a
position close behind the galloping pony without
breaking out of his rangy trot. Occasionally Isobel
flung back a gay remark over her shoulder. Ashton
did not respond. He rode after her, silent and depressed,
his eyes fixed longingly on her graceful form,
ever fleeing forward before him as he advanced.</p>
<p>Once clear of the sagebrush, she drew rein for him
to come up. They rode side by side across Dry Fork
and over the divide. When they stopped at the corral
she would have unsaddled her pony had he not
begged leave to do her the service. As reward, she
waited until he could accompany her to the house.</p>
<p>They found her father and Gowan resting in the
cool porch after a particularly hard day&#8217;s ride. The
puncher was strumming soft melodies on a guitar.
Knowles was peering at his report of the Reclamation
Service, held to windward of a belching cloud of pipe
smoke. His daughter darted to him regardless of
the offending incense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What do you think!
Mr. Blake is coming to visit us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blake?&#8221; repeated the cowman, staring blankly
over his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Blake, the engineer&ndash;&ndash;the great
Thomas Blake of the Zariba Dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James!&#8221; swore Gowan, dropping his guitar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
and springing up to confront Ashton with deadly
menace in his cold eyes. &#8220;This is what comes of
nursing scotched rattlers! This here tenderfoot
skunk has been foreriding for that engineer! I
warned you, Mr. Knowles! I told you he had sent
for him to come out here and cut up our range with
his damned irrigation schemes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I send for Blake&ndash;&ndash;I?&#8221; protested Ashton. He
burst into a discordant laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laugh, will you?&#8221; said Gowan, dropping his hand
to his hip.</p>
<p>The girl flung herself before him. &#8220;Stop! stop,
Kid! Are you locoed? He had nothing to do with
it. I myself sent for Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You!</i>&#8221; cried Gowan.</p>
<p>The cowman slowly stood up, his eyes fixed on the
girl in an incredulous stare. &#8220;Chuckie,&#8221; he half
whispered, &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; done it. You&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
dreaming, honey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Listen, Daddy! It&#8217;s been growing on you
so&ndash;&ndash;your fear that we&#8217;ll lose our range. I thought
if Mr. Blake came and told you it can&#8217;t be done&ndash;&ndash;Don&#8217;t
you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he finds it can?&#8221; huskily demanded
Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m sure he can&#8217;t. If he builds a
reservoir, where could he get enough water to fill it?
The watershed above us is too small. He couldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
impound more than three thousand acre feet of flood
waters at the utmost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the whole river going to waste, down
in Deep Ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; queried her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, Mr. Knowles! How would he ever get
a drop of water out of that awful chasm?&#8221; exclaimed
Ashton. &#8220;I looked down into it. The river is
thousands of feet down. It must be way below the
level of Dry Mesa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that,&#8221; replied the cowman.
&#8220;Holes are mighty deceiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what if it ain&#8217;t so deep as the mesa?&#8221;
argued Gowan, for once half in accord with Ashton.
&#8220;It shore is deep enough, ain&#8217;t it? Even allowing
that this man Blake is the biggest engineer in the U.S.,
how&#8217;s he going to pump that water up over the rim
of the ca&ntilde;on? The devil himself couldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am mistaken regarding the depth, that is, if
the river really is higher than the mesa,&#8221; remarked
Ashton, &#8220;there is the possibility that it might be tapped
by a tunnel through the side of High Mesa. But
even if it is possible, it still is quite out of the question.
The cost would be prohibitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Daddy!&#8221; exclaimed Isobel. &#8220;Lafe
knows. He&#8217;s an engineer himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; growled her father, frowning
heavily at Ashton. &#8220;You never told me you&#8217;re an
engineer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I told Miss Chuckie the first day I met her,&#8221; explained
Ashton. &#8220;Ever since then I&#8217;ve been so busy
trying to be something else&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore you have!&#8221; jeered Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about Mr. Blake, Daddy?&#8221; interposed Isobel.
&#8220;I&#8217;m certain he&#8217;ll find that no irrigation project is
possible; and if <i>he</i> says so, you will be able to give
up worrying about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s your idea,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Of course,
honey, you meant well. But he&#8217;s a pretty big man,
according to all the reports. What if he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The
cowman stopped, unable to state the calamity he
dreaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what if?&#8221; bravely declared his daughter.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it best to know the worst, and have it over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know but what you&#8217;re right,
honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your say, Mr. Knowles,&#8221; put in Gowan.
&#8220;If you want the tenderfeet on your range, all right.
If you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll engage to head back any bunch of
engineers agoing, and I don&#8217;t care whether they&#8217;re
dogies or longhorns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is to be no surveying party,&#8221; explained Isobel.
&#8220;Mr. Blake is coming to visit us with his wife
and baby. Here is his letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; ejaculated Knowles. He read the letter
with frowning deliberation, and passed it on to Gowan.
&#8220;Well, he seems to be square enough. Guess we&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
have to send over for him, honey, long as you asked
him to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you will, Daddy!&#8221; she cried. She gave him
a delicious kiss and cuddled against his shoulder coaxingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me go over in the buckboard for
them, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of early in the season for you to begin
hankering after city folks,&#8221; he sought to tease her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But think of the baby!&#8221; she exclaimed as excitedly
as a little girl over the prospect of a doll. &#8220;A baby
on our ranch! I simply must see it at the earliest
possible moment! Besides, it will look better for our
hospitality for me to meet Mrs. Blake at the train,
since she&ndash;&ndash;That&#8217;s something I meant to ask you,
Lafe. What does Mr. Blake mean by saying they
will leave the servants in the car?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume they are traveling in Mr. Leslie&#8217;s
private car, and will have it sidetracked at Stockchute,&#8221;
answered Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Whee-ew!</i>&#8221; ejaculated Knowles. &#8220;Private car!
And we&#8217;re supposed to feed them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just because of the change we will give them
that they are coming out here,&#8221; surmised Isobel.
&#8220;Look at the letter again. Mr. Blake expressly
writes that his wife wishes to rough-it. Of course
she cannot know what real roughing-it means. But
if she is coming to us without a maid, we shall like her
as much as&ndash;&ndash;as Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>SELF-DEFENSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Nothing more was said about the trip to town
until late Wednesday evening. As Knowles
slammed shut his book and the young men rose to
withdraw to the bunkhouse, he asked Gowan casually:
&#8220;Got those harness hawsses in the corral?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brought &#8217;em in this afternoon. Greased the
buckboard and overhauled the harness. Everything&#8217;s
in shape,&#8221; answered the puncher.</p>
<p>Knowles merely nodded. Yet in the morning, immediately
after the usual early breakfast, Gowan
went up to the corral and returned driving a lively
pair of broncos to the old buckboard. Ashton
happened to come around the house as Knowles
stepped from the front door. The cowman was followed
by his daughter, attired in a new riding habit
and a fashionable hat with a veil.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just in time, Lafe,&#8221; said Knowles.
&#8220;Saddle a couple of hawsses and follow Chuckie to
town. I misdoubt that seat is cramped for three,
and a baby to boot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;it looks quite wide to me,&#8221; said Ashton,
flushing and drawing back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the size of Blake and his lady&ndash;&ndash;I
don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the cowman. &#8220;Just the same, I want
you to go along with Chuckie. There&#8217;s not a
puncher in this section would harm her, drunk or
sober; but the fellows that come in and go out on
the railroad are sometimes another sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&ndash;&ndash;if necessary,&#8221; stammered Ashton.
&#8220;Yet may I ask you to excuse me? In the event of
trouble, Mr. Gowan, you know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great snakes!&#8221; called Gowan from the buckboard.
&#8220;Needn&#8217;t ask <i>me</i> to go, twice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t spare you today,&#8221; said Knowles, his keen
eyes fixed on Ashton in unconcealed amazement.</p>
<p>It was inconceivable. For the first time in his
career as an employ&eacute;, the tenderfoot was attempting
to evade a duty,&ndash;&ndash;a duty that comprised a fifty-mile
ride in company with Miss Isobel Knowles!</p>
<p>The girl looked at Ashton with a perfect composure
that betrayed no trace of her feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no reason whatever why Lafe
should go, if he does not wish to,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;Any of my hawsses will lead to the buckboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to town with you,&#8221; said Knowles, his
jaw setting hard with stubborn determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, Mr. Knowles, if you really think
it necessary,&#8221; reluctantly acquiesced Ashton. He put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
his hand into his pocket, shrugged, and asked in a hesitating
manner: &#8220;May I request&ndash;&ndash;I have only a
small amount left from that five dollars. If you consider
there are any wages owing me&ndash;&ndash;Going to
town, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said the cowman. &#8220;So that&#8217;s what you
stuck on. &#8217;Fraid of running out of change with a
lady along. Here&#8217;s the balance of your first month&#8217;s
wages, and more, if you want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out a fat wallet and began counting out
banknotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not so many,&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;I wish only
what you consider as owing to me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take an even hundred,&#8221; ordered Knowles,
forcing the money on him. &#8220;A man doesn&#8217;t feel
just right in town unless he&#8217;s well heeled. Only don&#8217;t
show more than a ten at a time in the saloon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have chosen me to act as your daughter&#8217;s escort,&#8221;
replied Ashton.</p>
<p>Quick to catch the inference of his remark, Isobel
flashed him a look of approval, but called banteringly
as she darted out to the buckboard: &#8220;Better move,
if you expect to get near enough to escort me, this side
of Stockchute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan sprang down to hand her into the buckboard.
She took the reins from him and spoke to
the fidgetting broncos. They plunged forward and
started off on a lope. Ashton perceived that she did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
not intend to wait for him. He caught Gowan&#8217;s look
of mingled exultance and envy, and dashed for the
corral. Rocket was outside, but at his call trotted
to meet him, whinnying for his morning&#8217;s lump of
sugar. Ashton flung on saddle and bridle, and slipped
inside the corral to rope his own pony. Haste made
him miss the two first throws. At last he noosed
the pony, and slapped on the girl&#8217;s saddle and bridle.</p>
<p>As he raced off, pounding the pony with his rope to
keep him alongside Rocket, Knowles waved to him
from the house. He had saddled up in less than
twice the time that Gowan could have done it,&ndash;&ndash;which
was a record for a tenderfoot. He waved
back, but his look was heavy despite the excitement of
the pursuit.</p>
<p>He expected to overtake Isobel in a few minutes.
This he could have done had he been able to give
Rocket free rein. But he had to hold back for the
slower-gaited pony. Also, the girl had more of a
start than he had at first realized, and she did her
best to hold the handicap. Hitched to the light buckboard,
her young broncos could have run a good part
of the way to Stockchute. She was far out on the
flat before she at last tired of the wild bumping over
ruts and sagebrush roots, and pulled her horses down
to a walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have kept ahead clear across to the hills,&#8221;
she flung back at him as he galloped up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have been so reckless!&#8221; he reproached.
&#8220;Every moment I&#8217;ve been dreading to
see you bounced out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fun of it,&#8221; she declared, her cheeks
aglow and eyes sparkling with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the road is so rough!&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier for you to ride my pony?
He&#8217;s like a rocking-chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she refused. But she smiled, by no means
ill pleased at his solicitude for her comfort. She
halted the broncos, and said cordially: &#8220;Tie the
saddle hawsses to the back rail, and pile in. We may
as well be sociable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hastened to accept the invitation. She moved
over to the left side of the seat and relinquished the
lines to him. With most young ladies this would have
been a matter-of-course proceeding; from so accomplished
a horsewoman it was a tactful compliment.
He appreciated it at its full value, and his mood lightened.
They rattled gayly along, on across the flats,
up and down among the pi&ntilde;on clad hills, and through
the sage and greasewood of the valleys.</p>
<p>He had thought the country a desolate wilderness;
but now it seemed a Garden of Eden. Never had the
girl&#8217;s loveliness been more intoxicating, never had her
manner to him been more charming and gracious.
He could not resist the infection of her high spirits.
For the greater part of the trip he gave himself over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
to the delight of her merry eyes and dimpling, rosy
cheeks, her adorable blushes and gay repartee.</p>
<p>All earthly journeys and joys have an ending. The
buckboard creaked up over the round of the last and
highest hill, and they came in sight of the little shack
town down across the broad valley. Though five
miles away, every house, every telegraph pole, even
the thin lines of the railroad rails appeared through
the dry clear air as distinct as a miniature painting.
Miles beyond, on the far side of the valley, uprose
the huge bulk of Split Peak, with its white-mantled
shoulders and craggy twin peaks.</p>
<p>But neither Ashton nor Isobel exclaimed on this
magnificent view of valley and peak. Each fell silent
and gazed soberly down at the dozen scattered shacks
that marked the end of their outward trip. Rapidly
the gravity of Ashton&#8217;s face deepened to gloom and
from gloom to dejection. The horses would have
broken into a lope on the down grade. He held them
to a walk.</p>
<p>Chancing to gaze about and see his face, the girl
started from her bright-eyed daydream. &#8220;Why,
Lafe! what is it?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;You look as you
did the other day, when you brought the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;everything!&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;As what?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>He shrugged hopelessly, hesitated, and drew out the
roll of bills forced on him by Knowles. &#8220;Tell me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
please, just how much of this is mine, at your father&#8217;s
usual rate of wages, and deducting the real value of
that calf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I can&#8217;t just say, offhand,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;But why should you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tell you as soon as&ndash;&ndash;but first&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
drew out his watch. &#8220;This cost me two hundred and
fifty dollars. It is the only thing I have worth trading.
Would you take it in exchange for Rocket and
the balance of this hundred dollars over and above
what is due me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;no, of course, I wouldn&#8217;t think of such
a thing. It would be absurd, cheating yourself that
way. Anyhow, Rocket is your horse to ride, as long
as you wish to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would like him for my own. How about
trading him for my pony and the wages due me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that wouldn&#8217;t be an unfair bargain. Your
hawss is the best cow pony of the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you to agree, Miss Chuckie!
Here is all the money; and here is the watch. I wish
you to accept it from me as a&ndash;&ndash;memento.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashton!&#8221; she exclaimed, indignantly widening
the space between them as much as the seat would
permit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please!&#8221; he begged. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand?
I am going away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going away?&#8221; she echoed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I cannot stay after he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not? Has he injured you? Are you
afraid of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m afraid that you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Ashton&#8217;s voice
sank to a whisper&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that you will believe what he&ndash;&ndash;what
they will say against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she commented, her expression shifting
swiftly from sympathetic concern to doubt.</p>
<p>He caught the change in her look and tone, and
flushed darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are sometimes two sides to a story,&#8221; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me your side now,&#8221; she suggested, with her
usual directness.</p>
<p>His eyes fell before her clear honest gaze. His
flush deepened. He hung his head, biting his twisted
lip. After several moments he began to speak in a
hesitating broken murmur:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been&ndash;&ndash;wild. But I graduated from
Tech.&ndash;&ndash;not at the foot of my class. My father&ndash;&ndash;always
busy piling up millions&ndash;&ndash;never a word or
thought for me, except when I overspent my allowance.
I was in a&ndash;&ndash;fast set. My father&ndash;&ndash;threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
me. I had to make good. I took a position in
old Leslie&#8217;s office&ndash;&ndash;Genevieve&#8217;s father. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, licked his lips, hesitated, and abruptly
went on again, this time speaking with almost glib facility:
&#8220;There was an engineers&#8217; contest for a projected
bridge over Michamac Strait. I started to draw
plans, that I might enter the contest, but I did not
finish in time. The plans of the other engineers were
all rejected. I continued to work on mine. After
the contest I happened to pick up a piece of torn plan
out of the office wastebasket, and it gave me a suggestion
how to improve the central span of my
bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked the girl, her interest deepening.</p>
<p>He again licked his lips, hesitated, and continued:
&#8220;There was no name on that torn plan&ndash;&ndash;nothing to
indicate to whom it had belonged. So I used it&ndash;&ndash;that
is, the suggestion I got from it, and was awarded
the bridge on my plans. This made me the Resident
Engineer of the bridge, and I had it almost completed
when this man Blake came back from Africa after
Genevieve, and claimed that I had&ndash;&ndash;had stolen his
plans of the bridge. It seems they were lost in Mr.
Leslie&#8217;s office. He claimed he had handed them in to
me for the contest. But so had all the other contestants,
and their plans were not lost. It may have been
that one of the doorkeepers tore his plans up, out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
revenge. Blake was a very rough brute of a fellow
at that time. He quarreled with the doorkeeper because
the man would not admit him to see Mr. Leslie&ndash;&ndash;threatened
to smash him. Afterwards he accused
Mr. Leslie of stealing his plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no! he couldn&#8217;t have done that! He
can&#8217;t be that kind of a man!&#8221; protested Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true! Even he will not deny it. Old Leslie
thought him crazy&ndash;&ndash;then. It was different when he
came back and accused me! He had been shipwrecked
with Genevieve. They were alone together all those
weeks, and so one can&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Ashton checked himself.
&#8220;No, you must not think&ndash;&ndash;He saved her. When
they came back he claimed the bridge as his own&ndash;&ndash;those
lost plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His plans? So that was it! And you&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they believed him. What was my word
against his with Genevieve and Leslie. Leslie&#8217;s consulting
engineer was an old pal of Blake&#8217;s. So of
course I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll say though that Blake agreed to put
it that I had only borrowed his idea of the central
span.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was generous of him, if he really believed&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&ndash;&ndash;did Genevieve? Do they believe it
now? You see why I must go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t any such thing,&#8221; rejoined the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;When they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
coming here, believing I did it! They must believe
it, all of them! And my father&ndash;&ndash;after all this time&ndash;&ndash;They
agreed not to tell him. Yet he has found
out. That letter, up at the waterhole&ndash;&ndash;it was from
his lawyers. He had cut me off&ndash;&ndash;branded me as an
outcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without waiting to hear your side&ndash;&ndash;without asking
you to explain? How unjust! how unfair!&#8221; cried
Isobel.</p>
<p>Ashton winced. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I told you I&ndash;&ndash;my record
was against me. But I was his son&ndash;&ndash;he had no right
to brand me as a&ndash;&ndash;a thief! My valet read the letter.
He must have told the guide&ndash;&ndash;the scoundrels!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears of chagrin gathered in the young man&#8217;s dark
eyes. He bit his lip until the blood ran.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-oh!&#8221; sighed the girl. &#8220;It&#8217;s all been frightfully
unjust! You haven&#8217;t had fair play! I shall
tell Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not him!&ndash;&ndash;not him!&#8221; Ashton&#8217;s voice was
almost shrill. &#8220;All I wish is to slip away, before they
see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean, run away?&#8221; she said, quietly
placing her little gauntlet-gloved hand on his arm.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to run away, Lafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221; he asked, his eyes dark with bitter
despair. &#8220;Would you have me return, to be booted
off the range when they tell your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait and see,&#8221; she replied, gazing at him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
a reassuring smile. &#8220;You&#8217;ve proved yourself a right
smart puncher&ndash;&ndash;for a tenderfoot. You&#8217;re in the
West, the good old-style West, where it&#8217;s a man&#8217;s
present record that counts; not what he has been or
what he has done. No, you&#8217;re not going to run.
You&#8217;re going to face it out&ndash;&ndash;and going to stay to
learn your new profession of puncher and&ndash;&ndash;<i>man</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will not wish to associate with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they will,&#8221; she predicted. &#8220;I shall see to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took heart a little from her cheery, positive assurance.
&#8220;Well, if you insist, I shall not go until
they show&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll not recognize you at first. That will give
me a chance to speak before they can say anything disagreeable.
I&#8217;m sure Mr. Blake will understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;Genevieve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she married him when he was as rough as you
say, and if he agrees to let bygones be bygones, you
need have no fear of Mrs. Blake. Only be sure to
go into raptures over the baby. Tell her it&#8217;s the perfect
image of its father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if it isn&#8217;t?&#8221; objected Ashton gloomily.</p>
<p>She dimpled. &#8220;One must allow for the difference
in age; and there&#8217;s always some resemblance&ndash;&ndash;each
must have a mouth and eyes and ears and a nose.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught himself on the verge of laughter. Her
eyes were fixed upon him, pure and honest and dancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
with mirth. A sudden flood of crimson swept up his
face from his bristly, tanned chin to his white forehead.
He averted his gaze from hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re <i>good</i>!&#8221; he choked out. &#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve&ndash;&ndash;But
I can&#8217;t go&ndash;&ndash;when you tell me to
stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t,&#8221; she lightly rejoined.
&#8220;Look! There&#8217;s the train coming. Push on the
lines!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE MEETING</h3>
</div>
<p>A word started the horses into a lope. The
buckboard was whirled along over the last two
miles to Stockchute in a wild race against the train.
The steam horse won. It had sidetracked the private
car attached to the rear of the last pullman and was
puffing away westward, when Ashton guided his running
team in among the crude shacks of the town. He
swung around at a more moderate pace towards the
big chute for cattle-loading, and fetched up a few yards
out from the rear step of the private car.</p>
<p>An assiduous porter had already swung down with
a box step. A big, square-faced, square-framed man
of twenty-eight or thirty stepped out into the car vestibule.
He sprang to the ground as Miss Knowles
stepped from the buckboard. She had lowered her
veil, but it failed to mask the extreme brilliancy of her
eyes and her quick changes of color. Her face, flushed
from the excitement of the race into town, went white
when she first saw the man in the vestibule; flushed
again when he sprang down; again paled; and, last of
all, glowed radiantly as she advanced to meet him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>He hastened to her, baring his big head of its
Panama, and staring at her fashionable hat and dress
in frank surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake!&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>At the sound of her voice he started and fixed his
light blue eyes on her veiled face with a keen glance.
She turned pale and as quickly blushed, as if embarrassed
by his scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me!&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;You are Miss
Knowles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowles?&#8221; he repeated, half to himself.
&#8220;Strange! Haven&#8217;t I met you before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Denver?&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;I spend my
winters in Denver. But there was one in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t be either. You must excuse me,
Miss Knowles. There was something about your
voice and face&ndash;&ndash;rather threw me off my balance. If
you&#8217;ll kindly overlook the bungling start-off! I&#8217;m
greatly pleased to meet you. My wife will be, too.
May I ask you to step aboard the car?&ndash;&ndash;No, here she
is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A graceful, rather small lady, dressed with elegant
simplicity, had come out into the car vestibule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenny, here&#8217;s Miss Knowles now,&#8221; said Blake.
&#8220;She came to meet us herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very good of you, Miss Knowles,&#8221; said
the lady, as the two advanced towards her. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
are very glad to meet you. Will you not come up out
of the sun?&#8221;</p>
<p>The white-uniformed porter promptly stood at attention.
Blake as promptly offered his hand. The
girl accepted his assistance and mounted the car steps
with an absence of awkwardness instantly noted by
Mrs. Blake. That lady held out a somewhat thin
white hand as Isobel drew off her gauntlet gloves.
But she did not stop with the light firm handclasp.
Lifting the girl&#8217;s veil, she kissed her full on her coral
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be friends,&#8221; she stated, a smile in her
hazel eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; murmured the girl, blushing with delight.
&#8220;The only question is whether you will like
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake patted the plump, sunbrowned hand that
she had not yet relinquished. She was little if any
older than the girl, but her air was that of matronly
wisdom. &#8220;My dear, can you doubt it? I was prepared
to like even the kind of young woman my husband
told me to expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bronco Bess, Queen of the Cattle Camp,&#8221; suggested
the girl, dimpling. &#8220;Wait till you see me rope
and hogtie a steer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake smiled, and looked across at Ashton,
who sat motionless under the shadow of his big sombrero,
his face half averted from the car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a real surprise for you,&#8221; said the girl.
&#8220;Mr. Blake, if I may tell it to you also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake swung up the steps, hat in hand. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
be half as pleasant as the surprise you&#8217;ve already given
us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; she replied, with a quick change to
gravity. She looked earnestly into their faces.
&#8220;Still, I hope&ndash;&ndash;yes, I really believe it will please you
when you consider it. But first, I want to tell you that
out here it&#8217;s our notion that a man should be rated
according to his present life, and not blamed for his
past mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; agreed Mrs. Blake, with a swift
glance at her husband. &#8220;If a man has mounted to a
higher level, he should be upheld, not dragged down
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good old-style Western fair play,&#8221; added
Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you take it that way!&#8221; said Isobel.
&#8220;A young man utterly ruined in fortune&ndash;&ndash;partly at
least through his own fault&ndash;&ndash;came to us and asked
to be hired. He has been a hard worker and a gentleman.
His name is Lafayette Ashton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashton?&#8221; said Blake, his face as impassive as a
granite mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He has told me all about the bridge. He
wished to go away, because he thought you and Mrs.
Blake would not like to meet him. I told him you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
would be willing to let bygones be bygones, and help
him start off with a new tally card.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lafayette Ashton working&ndash;&ndash;as a cowboy!&#8221; murmured
Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is still a good deal of a tenderfoot. But he
is learning fast; and work!&ndash;&ndash;the way he pesters
Daddy to find him something to do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly must be a changed man,&#8221; dryly commented
Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cherchez la femme</i>,&#8221; said his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Blake!&#8221; protested the girl, blushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Find the woman,&#8217;&#8221; explained Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; he said, fixing his twinkling eyes on
the rosy-faced girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure it has not been because of me&ndash;&ndash;at
least not altogether,&#8221; she qualified with her uncompromising
honesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t blame him even if it was altogether,&#8221;
said Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will be willing to overlook your past
trouble with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you say he has straightened out&ndash;&ndash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good of you! That&#8217;s what I expected of
you!&#8221; exclaimed the girl. &#8220;That is he, in the buckboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word, Blake started down the car steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring him here at once, Tom,&#8221; said Mrs. Blake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Her husband went up beside the motionless figure
in the buckboard and held out his hand. &#8220;Glad to
meet you, Ashton,&#8221; he said with matter-of-fact heartiness.
&#8220;Jenny wants you to come to her. We&#8217;re not
ready to start, as we were not certain we would be
met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Blake wishes me to come!&#8221; mumbled
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Blake, gripping the other&#8217;s hesitatingly
extended hand.</p>
<p>Ashton flushed darkly. &#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t leave the
horses,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>Blake signed to the porter, who hastened forward.
&#8220;Hold the lines for this gentleman, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton reluctantly gave the lines into the mulatto&#8217;s
sallow hands and stepped from the buckboard. His
head hung forward as he followed Blake. But at the
foot of the steps he removed his sombrero and forced
himself to look up. Isobel was smiling down at him
encouragingly. He looked from her to Mrs. Blake,
his handsome face crimson with shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Lafayette?&#8221; Mrs. Blake greeted
him with quiet cordiality. &#8220;This is a pleasant surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes, indeed! I&ndash;&ndash;yes, very!&#8221; he stammered,
so embarrassed that he would have stuck at
the foot of the steps had not Blake started him up with
a vigorous boost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Blake gave him her hand. &#8220;You look so
strong and hearty!&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;It speaks well
for the fare Miss Knowles provides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that credit is due our Jap chef,&#8221; laughed the
girl. &#8220;I can cut out a cow from the herd better than
I can bone a chop. But the butter and eggs and cream
that are awaiting you&ndash;&ndash;Which reminds me that
we&#8217;ve yet to see It.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It?&#8221; asked Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, him&ndash;&ndash;the <i>baby</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear girl!&#8221; cooed Mrs. Blake. &#8220;Come
in and see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isobel followed her into the car. Blake nodded to
Ashton. But the younger man shrank away from the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll kindly excuse me,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It
would remind me too much of&ndash;&ndash;the time when&ndash;&ndash;No,
I&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented Blake with ready understanding.
&#8220;How do you like this country? I went
through here once on a railway survey. It&#8217;s rare
good luck&ndash;&ndash;this chance to visit Miss Knowles. Jenny
is a little run down, as you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall trust that her visit to this locality will soon
quite restore her,&#8221; remarked Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will. The doctors said Maine; I said Colorado.
It has done you no end of good. You are looking
particularly fine and fit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It has helped me&ndash;&ndash;in more ways than one,&#8221; murmured
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear you say it!&#8221; responded Blake in
hearty approval.</p>
<p>Ashton turned from him as Isobel appeared in the
doorway, cuddling a lusty, rosy-cheeked baby. The
mother hovered close behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at him!&#8221; jeered Blake with heavily feigned
derision. &#8220;Did you ever see such a big, fat, lubberly&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, look at him, Lafe,&#8221; said the girl, stepping
out into the vestibule. &#8220;He is only a yearling, but
isn&#8217;t he just the perfect image of his father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton burst into a ringing laugh, but abruptly
checked himself at sight of the sober face of the young
mother. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg pardon!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Knowles&ndash;&ndash;that is what she told me
to tell you about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t play up worth a little bit, Lafe!&#8221;
complained the girl.</p>
<p>It was Blake&#8217;s turn to laugh. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; he accused.
&#8220;Schemed to frame up a case on us did
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife smiled faintly, not altogether certain that
an aspersion had not been cast upon her chuckling
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s partly true, really,&#8221; remarked Ashton,
peering at the baby&#8217;s big pale-blue eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>Blake burst into a hilarious roar. But Mrs. Blake
now beamed upon Ashton. &#8220;Then you, too, see the
resemblance, Lafayette! Isn&#8217;t it wonderful, and he
so young? His name is Thomas Herbert Vincent
Leslie Blake.&ndash;&ndash;Now, my dear, if you please, I shall
take him in. We must be preparing to start, if it is
so long a drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let me hold him until you and Mr. Blake are
ready,&#8221; begged the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not quite sure that&ndash;&ndash;You will be careful
not to drop him? He is tremendously strong,
and he squirms,&#8221; dubiously assented the fond mother.
&#8220;Come, Tom. We must not keep Miss Knowles
waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake disappeared with her into the luxuriously
furnished car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a dear?&#8221; cooed the girl, clasping the
baby to her bosom and kissing his chubby clenched
hands. He stared up into her glowing face with his
round light-blue eyes. &#8220;Thomas Blake!&ndash;&ndash;Tom
Blake!&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>Ashton did not heed the words. He was gazing
too intently at the girl and the child. His eyes
glistened with a wonderment and longing so exquisitely
intense that it was like a pain. The girl sank down in
one of the cane chairs and laid the baby on his back.
He kicked and gurgled, seized one of his upraised feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
and thrust a pink big toe in between his white milk
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more than you can do, Lafe!&#8221; challenged
the girl.</p>
<p>She glanced up, dimpling with merriment,&ndash;&ndash;met the
adoration in his eyes, and looked down, blushing. He
attempted to speak, but the words choked into an incoherent
sound like a sob. He jumped from the car
and hurried to take the lines from the porter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE OTHER LADY&#8217;S HUSBAND</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Knowles did not seem to observe Ashton&#8217;s
deflection. She remained worshipfully
downbent over the wriggling, chuckling baby until its
parents reappeared.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake had changed to an easy and serviceable
dress of plain, strong material. The skirt, cut to
walking length, showed that her feet and ankles were
protected by a pair of absurdly small laced boots.
Her husband had shifted to an equally serviceable costume&ndash;&ndash;flannel
shirt, broad-brimmed felt hat, and
surveyor&#8217;s boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crossing the plains we packed a trunk with what
we considered most necessary,&#8221; said Mrs. Blake, as
she took the baby. &#8220;It is not a large one, and in addition
there is only my satchel and the level and the
lunch my maid is putting up for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is room for more, if you wish,&#8221; replied Isobel.
&#8220;But we can send over here for anything you
need, any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to let us really rough-it!&#8221; complained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Mrs. Blake, as her husband swung her to the
ground. &#8220;Were it not for Thomas Herbert&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;We&#8217;d go to Africa again and eat lions,&#8221; Blake
completed the sentence. &#8220;Wait, though&ndash;&ndash;we may
have a chance at mountain lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The porter had gone to help a manservant fetch
the trunk from the other end of the car. Isobel untied
the saddle horses from the rear of the buckboard.
The trunk was lifted in, and Blake lashed it on, together
with his level rod and tripod, using Ashton&#8217;s
lariat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Level is in the trunk,&#8221; he explained, in response
to Ashton&#8217;s look of inquiry. &#8220;I suppose we ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will be better if Lafe drives,&#8221; objected
Isobel. &#8220;I am so reckless, and you don&#8217;t know the
road, as he does. The only thing is Rocket&ndash;&ndash;Lafe
has about trained him out of his tricks. But I should
warn you that the hawss has been rather vicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom will ride him,&#8221; confidently stated Mrs.
Blake.</p>
<p>Her husband took the bridle reins of the big horse
and mounted him with the agility of a cowboy. For
a moment Rocket stood motionless. Then, whether
because of Blake&#8217;s weight or the fact that he was a
stranger, all the beast&#8217;s newly acquired docility vanished.
He began to plunge and buck even more
violently than when first mounted by Ashton.</p>
<p>Half a hundred Stockchuteites&ndash;&ndash;all the residents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
of the town and several floaters&ndash;&ndash;had come down to
inspect the palatial private car and its passengers. At
Rocket&#8217;s first leap these highly interested spectators
broke into a murmur of joyful anticipation. They
were about to see the millionaire tenderfoot pull
leather.</p>
<p>Yet somehow the event failed to transpire. Blake
sat the flat saddle as if glued fast to it. His knees
and legs were crushing against the sides of the leaping,
whirling beast with the firmness of an iron vise.
He held both hands upraised, away from the
&#8220;leather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently Rocket&#8217;s efforts began to flag. Instead
of seeking to quiet the frantic beast, Blake began to
whoop and to strike him with his hat. Thus taunted,
Rocket resorted to his second trick. He took the bit
in his teeth and started to bolt. The crowd scattered
before the rush of the runaway. But they need not
have moved. Blake reached down on each side of
the beast&#8217;s outstretched neck and pulled. Tough-mouthed
as he was, Rocket could not resist that powerful
grip. His head was drawn down and backwards
until his trumpet nostrils blew against his deep chest.
After half a dozen wild plunges, he was forced to a
stand, snorting but subdued.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some riding, Miss Chuckie!&#8221; called the
burly sheriff of the county. &#8220;Your guest forks a
hawss like a buster.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>The girl rode forward beside Blake, her face radiant.
She paid him the highest of compliments by taking
his riding as a matter of course; but in her eyes
was a look strangely like that of his wife&#8217;s fond gaze,&ndash;&ndash;a
look of pride at his achievement, rather than admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ride ahead of the team to keep clear of the
dust,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>He twisted about and saw that Ashton was starting
to drive after them. His wife&#8217;s elderly maid was
waving her handkerchief from one of the car windows.
The porter and the manservant stood at attention.
He exchanged a nod and smile with his wife, patted
Rocket&#8217;s arched neck and clicked to him to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great, Miss Knowles!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I did
not look for such fun, first crack out of the box.
And&ndash;&ndash;if you don&#8217;t mind my saying it&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s such a
jolly surprise your being what you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl blushed with pleasure. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;we have
been so eager to meet you,&#8221; she murmured. She
added hurriedly, &#8220;On account of your wonderful work
as an engineer, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have suspected Ashton of bragging
for me,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&ndash;&ndash;he says you have a remarkable knack
of hitting on the solution of problems. But it&#8217;s in
the engineering journals and reports that we&#8217;ve read
about your work. Perhaps that is why you thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
we had met before. After reading about you so
much, I felt that I already knew you, and so my manner,
you know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head at this seemingly ingenuous explanation.
&#8220;No, there is something about your voice
and face&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His eyes clouded with the grief of a
painful memory; his head sank forward until his square
chin touched his broad chest. He muttered brokenly:
&#8220;But that&#8217;s impossible.... Anyway&ndash;&ndash;better for
them they died&ndash;&ndash;better than to live after....&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind her veil the girl&#8217;s face became deathly
white. He raised his head and looked at her with a
wistful gleam of hope. She had averted her face
from him and was gazing off at the hills with dim
unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Miss Knowles,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but do you
mind if I ask what is your first name?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated almost imperceptibly before replying:
&#8220;I am called Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;Chuckie Knowles. Doesn&#8217;t
that sound cowgirlish? We always have a chuck-wagon
on the round-ups, you know. But it&#8217;s a name
that used to be quite common in the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it comes from the Spanish Chiquita,&#8221; he said.
He repeated the word with the soft caressing Spanish
accent, &#8220;<i>Che-ke&eacute;-tah!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>A flood of scarlet swept up into the girl&#8217;s pallid
face, and slowly subsided to her normal rich coloring.
After a short silence she asked in a conventional tone:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
&#8220;I suppose you are glad to get away from Chicago.
The last papers we received say that the East is
sweltering in one of those smothery heat waves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the humidity and close air that kills,&#8221; said
Blake. &#8220;I ought to know. I lived for years in the
slums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&ndash;&ndash;you really speak of it&ndash;&ndash;openly!&#8221; the
girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; he asked, astonished in turn at her
lack of tact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing,&#8221; she hastened to disclaim.
&#8220;Only I know&ndash;&ndash;have read about the dreadful conditions
in the Chicago slums. It is&ndash;&ndash;it must be so
painful to recall them&ndash;&ndash;That was so rude of me
to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he interrupted. To cover her evident
confusion he held up his white hand in the scorching
sunrays and commented jovially: &#8220;Talk about Eastern
heat&ndash;&ndash;this is a hundred and five Fahrenheit at
the very least! A-a-ah!&#8221; He drew in a deep breath
of the dry pure air. &#8220;This is something like! When
you get your land under ditch, you&#8217;ll have a paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you do not understand,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;We want you to find out and tell us that Dry Mesa
<i>cannot</i> be watered. Irrigation would break up
Daddy&#8217;s range and put him out of business. It is just
what we do not want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Blake, with instant comprehension of
the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it cannot be done. But there are so many
reclamation projects, and Daddy has read and read
about them until he almost has a bee in his bonnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you sent for me&ndash;&ndash;an engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I knew that when <i>you</i> told him our mesa
couldn&#8217;t be watered, he would stop worrying. You
know, you are quite a hero with us. We have read
all about your wonderful work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s pale eyes twinkled. &#8220;So I&#8217;m a hero.
Will you dynamite my pedestal if I figure out a way
to water your range?&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed him a troubled glance, but rallied for
a quick rejoinder: &#8220;Even you can&#8217;t pump the water
out of Deep Ca&ntilde;on, and Plum Creek is only a trickle
most of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you want me to make my report as dry as I
can write it,&#8221; he bantered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, suddenly serious. &#8220;We wish
the exact truth, though we hope you&#8217;ll find it dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are to blame if the matter does not
figure out your way,&#8221; he warned her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
given me a problem. If there is any possible way for
me to irrigate your mesa, I am bound to try my best
to work it out. Hadn&#8217;t you better head me off before
I start in? At present I haven&#8217;t the remotest
desire to do this except to comply with your wishes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as I told Daddy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If there really
is a way, the sooner we know it the better. It is the
uncertainty that is bothering Daddy. If your report
is for us, all well and good; if against us, he will stand
up and fight and forget about worrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight?&#8221; asked Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight the project, fight against the formation of
any irrigation district. He owns five sections. The
reservoir might have to be on his patented land.
He&#8217;d fight fair and square and hard&ndash;&ndash;to the last
ditch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a Dutchman&#8217;s saying?&#8221; asked Blake
humorously.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s tense face relaxed, and she burst out in
a ringing laugh. She shifted the conversation to less
serious subjects, and they cantered along together,
laughing and chatting like old friends.</p>
<p>By this time Ashton and Mrs. Blake had gradually
come to the same stage of pleasant comradeship.
Ashton had started the drive in a sullen mood, his
manner half resentful and wholly embarrassed. Of
this the lady was tactfully oblivious. Avoiding all
allusion to the catastrophe that had befallen him, she
told him the latest news of the mutual friends and
acquaintances in whom ordinarily he would have been
expected to be interested.</p>
<p>She even spoke casually of his father. His face contracted
with pain, but he showed no bitterness against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the parent who had disowned him. After that her
graciousness towards him redoubled. With Isobel for
excuse, she gradually shifted the conversation to ranch
life and his employment as cowboy. In many subtle
ways she conveyed to him her admiration of the manner
in which he had turned over a new leaf and was
making a clean fresh start in life.</p>
<p>After delicately intimating her feelings, she at once
turned to less personal topics. The last traces of his
embarrassment and moodiness left him, and he began
to talk quite at his ease, though with a certain reserve
that she attributed to the vast change in his fortunes.
In return for her kindness, he repaid her by showing a
real interest in Thomas Herbert Vincent Leslie Blake.</p>
<p>That young man spent his time chuckling and crowing
and kicking, until overcome with sleep. Two
hours out from Stockchute he awoke and vociferously
demanded nourishment. Promptly the party was
brought to a halt. They were among the pi&ntilde;ons on
one of the hillsides. While the baby took his dinner,
Isobel laid out the lunch and the men burned incense
in the guise of a pair of Havana cigars produced by
Blake.</p>
<p>The lunch might have been put up in the kitchen of
a first-class metropolitan hotel. The fruit was the
most luscious that money could buy; the sandwiches
and cake would have tempted a sated epicure; the mineral
water had come out of an ice chest so nearly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
frozen that it was still refreshingly cool. But&ndash;&ndash;what
was rather odd for a lunch packed in a private car&ndash;&ndash;it
included no wine or whiskey or liqueur. Blake
caught Ashton&#8217;s glance, and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;m still on the waterwagon,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a permanent seat. There have
been times when it looked as if I might be jolted off,
but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s never been the slightest chance of
that!&#8221; put in his wife. She looked at Isobel, her soft
eyes shining with love and pride. &#8220;Once he gets a
grip on anything, he never lets go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can believe that!&#8221; exclaimed the girl with
an enthusiasm that brought a shadow into the mobile
face of Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man can&#8217;t help holding on when he has something
to hold on for,&#8221; said Blake, gazing at his wife
and baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true!&#8221; agreed Ashton, his eyes on the
dimpled face of Isobel.</p>
<p>Refreshed by the delicious meal, the party prepared
to start on. But they did not travel as before. While
Ashton was considerately washing out the dusty nostrils
of the horses with water from his canteen, Isobel
decided to drive with Mrs. Blake. Declaring that it
would be like old times to sit a cowboy saddle, the big
engineer lengthened the girl&#8217;s stirrup leathers and
swung on to the pony. This left Rocket to his owner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>At first Ashton seemed inclined to be stiff with his
new road-mate. But as they jogged along, side by
side, over the hills and across the sagebrush flats, Blake
restricted his talk to impersonal topics and spared his
companion from any allusion to their past difficulties.
Throughout the ride, however, the two men maintained
a certain reserve towards each other, and at no time
approached the cordial intimacy that developed between
the girl and Mrs. Blake before the end of their
first mile together.</p>
<p>After telling merrily about her dual life as summer
cowgirl and winter society maiden, Isobel drifted
around, by seemingly casual association of ideas, to the
troublesome question of irrigation on Dry Mesa, and
from that to Blake and his work as an engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do so hope Mr. Blake finds that there is no
project practicable,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;He has warned
me that if there seems to be any chance to work out
an irrigation scheme on our mesa he is bound to try to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he would do it,&#8221; added Mrs. Blake with quiet
confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I hope and pray he will find there is no
chance, because Daddy would have to oppose him.
That would be such a pity! He and I have read so
much about Mr. Blake&#8217;s work that we have come to
regard him as our&ndash;&ndash;as one of our heroes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Blake smiled. It was very apparent, despite
the quietness and repression of her high-bred manner,
that she was very much in love with her husband.</p>
<p>The girl continued in a meekly deferential tone:
&#8220;So you will not mind my worshiping him. He is a
hero, a real hero! Isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were spoken with an earnestness and sincerity
that won Mrs. Blake to a like candor. &#8220;You
are quite right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Lafayette may have told
you how Mr. Blake and I were wrecked on the most
savage coast of Africa. He saved me from wild beasts
and tropical storms, from fever and snakes,&ndash;&ndash;from
death in a dozen horrible forms. Then, when he had
saved me&ndash;&ndash;and won me, he gave me up until he could
prove to himself that he was worthy of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did?&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;But of course!&ndash;&ndash;of
course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet that was nothing to the next proof of his
strength and manhood,&#8221; went on the proud wife.
&#8220;He destroyed a monster more frightful than any lion
or tropical snake&ndash;&ndash;he overcame the curse of drink
that had come down to him from&ndash;&ndash;one of his
parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From&ndash;&ndash;from his&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; whispered the girl, her
averted face white and drawn with pain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake had bent over to kiss the forehead of
her sleeping baby and did not see. &#8220;If only all parents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
knew what terrible misfortunes, what tortures,
their transgressions are apt to bring upon their innocent
children!&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he won his way up out of the&ndash;&ndash;the
slums,&#8221; said Isobel. &#8220;It must be some men fail
to do that because they have relatives to drag them
down&ndash;&ndash;their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems hard to say it, yet I do not know but that
you are right, my dear,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Blake. &#8220;Strong
men, if unhampered, have a chance to fight their way
up out of the social pit. But women and girls, even
when they escape the&ndash;&ndash;the worst down there, can
hardly hope ever to attain&ndash;&ndash;And of course those
that fall!&ndash;&ndash;Our dual code of morality is hideously
unjust to our sex, yet it still is the code under which we
live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl drew in a deep, sighing breath. Her eyes
were dark with anguish. Yet she forced a gay little
laugh. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we solemn sociologists! All we are
concerned with is that <i>he</i> has won his way up, and
there&#8217;s no one ever to drag him down or disgrace him;
and&ndash;&ndash;and you won&#8217;t be jealous if I set him up on a
pedestal and bring incense to him on my bended knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you must give Thomas Herbert his share at
the same time,&#8221; stipulated the mother.</p>
<p>The girl burst into prolonged and rather shrill
laughter that passed the bounds of good breeding.
Her emotion was so unrestrained that when she looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
about at her surprised companion her face was flushed
and her eyes were swimming with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, oh, do please forgive me!&#8221; she begged
with a humility as immoderate as had been her laughter.
&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t tell you why, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say no more, my dear,&#8221; soothed Mrs. Blake.
&#8220;You are merely a bit hysterical. Perhaps the excitement
of our coming, after your months of lonely ranch
life&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so good!&#8221; sighed the girl. &#8220;Yes, it was
due to&ndash;&ndash;your coming. But now the worst is over.
I&#8217;ll not shock you again with any more such outbursts.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, and began to talk of other things, with
somewhat unsteady but persistent gayety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A DESCENT</h3>
</div>
<p>When the party arrived at the ranch, the girl
hostess took Mrs. Blake to rest in the clean,
simply furnished room provided for the visitors.
Blake, after carrying in their trunk single-handed, went
to look around at the ranch buildings in company with
Ashton.</p>
<p>On returning to the house, the two found Knowles
and Gowan in the parlor with the ladies. Isobel had
already introduced them to Mrs. Blake and also to her
son. That young man was sprawled, face up, in the
cowman&#8217;s big hands, crowing and valiantly clutching at
his bristly mustache.</p>
<p>Gowan sat across from him, perfectly at ease in the
presence of the city lady. But, with his characteristic
lack of humor, he was unmoved by the laughable
spectacle presented by his employer and the baby, and
his manner was both reserved and watchful.</p>
<p>At sight of Blake, Isobel called to her father in
feigned alarm: &#8220;Look out, Daddy! Better stop
hazing that yearling. Here comes his sire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles gave the baby back to its half-fearful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
mother, and rose to greet his guest with hospitable
warmth: &#8220;Howdy, Mr. Blake! I&#8217;m downright
glad to meet you. Hope you&#8217;ve found things comfortable
and homelike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much so,&#8221; asserted Blake, his eyes twinkling.
&#8220;We came out expecting to rough-it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your lady won&#8217;t know the difference,&#8221; remarked
Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite mistaken, Daddy, really,&#8221; interposed
his daughter. &#8220;She and Mr. Blake were wrecked in
Africa and lived on roast leopards. We&#8217;ll have to
feed them on mountain lions and bobcats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean that, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; put in Gowan,
&#8220;I can get a bobcat in time for dinner tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl led the general outburst of laughter over
this serious proposal. &#8220;Oh! oh! Kid! You&#8217;ll be
the death of me!&ndash;&ndash;Yet I sent you a joke-book last
Christmas!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t see anything funny in it,&#8221; replied the
puncher. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t lost it, though. It came from
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>To cover the girl&#8217;s blush at this blunt disclosure of
sentiment, Mrs. Blake somewhat formally introduced
her husband to the puncher. He shook Blake&#8217;s hand
with like formality and politeness. But as their
glances met, his gray eyes shone with the same cold suspicion
with which he had regarded Ashton at their
first meeting. Before that look the engineer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
friendly eyes hardened to disks of burnished steel, and
his big fist released its cordial grip of the other&#8217;s small,
bony hand. He gave back hostility for hostility with
the readiness of a born fighter. Gowan was the first
to look away.</p>
<p>The incident passed so swiftly that only Knowles
observed the outflash of enmity. His words indicated
that he had anticipated the puncher&#8217;s attitude. He
addressed Blake seriously: &#8220;Kid has been with us
ever since he was a youngster and has always made
my interests his own. Chuckie has been telling us what
you said about putting through any project you once
started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake nodded. &#8220;Yes. That is why I suggested to
Miss Knowles that she call off the agreement under
which I came on this visit. We shall gladly pay board,
and I&#8217;ll merely knock around; or, if you prefer, we&#8217;ll
leave you and go back tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Daddy, no! we can&#8217;t allow our guests to leave,
when they&#8217;ve only just come!&#8221; protested Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for any talk about board,&#8221; added her father,
&#8220;you ought to know better, Mr. Blake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My apology!&#8221; admitted Blake. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been living
in the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains,&#8221; agreed the cowman. &#8220;Even as
far east as Denver&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve got a sister there; lives up
beyond the Capitol. But I&#8217;ve talked with other men
there from over this way. They all agree you might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
as well look for good cow pasture behind a sheep drive
as for hospitality in a city. Sometimes you can get
what you want, and all times you&#8217;re sure to get a
lot of attention you don&#8217;t want&ndash;&ndash;if you have money
to spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. But about my going ahead here?&#8221;
inquired Blake. &#8220;Say the word, and I put irrigation
on the shelf throughout our visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles shook his head thoughtfully. &#8220;No, I
reckon Chuckie is right. We&#8217;d best learn just how
we stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I work out a practical project? There&#8217;s
any amount of good land on your mesa. The lay of
it and the altitude ought to make it ideal for fruit.
If I see that the proposition is feasible, I shall be bound
to put water on all of your range that I can. I am
an engineer,&ndash;&ndash;I cannot let good land and water go to
waste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The land isn&#8217;t going to waste,&#8221; replied Knowles.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the best cattle range in this section, and it&#8217;s
being used for the purpose Nature intended. As for
the water, Chuckie has figured out there isn&#8217;t more
than three thousand acre feet of flood waters that can
be impounded off the watershed above us. That
wouldn&#8217;t pay for building any kind of a dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the devil himself couldn&#8217;t pump the water
up out of Deep Ca&ntilde;on,&#8221; put in Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil hasn&#8217;t much use for science,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Blake. &#8220;It has almost put him out of business. So
he is not apt to be well up on modern engineering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think you can do what the devil can&#8217;t?&#8221;
demanded Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can try. Unless you wish to call off the deal,
I shall ride around tomorrow and look over the country.
Maybe that will be sufficient to show me there
is no chance for irrigation, or, on the contrary, I may
have to run levels and do some figuring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you will know by tomorrow night?&#8221;
exclaimed Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something,&#8221; said the cowman.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you out first thing in the morning.&ndash;&ndash;Lafe,
show Mr. Blake the wash bench. There goes the first
gong.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, a little later, all came together again at the
supper table, nothing more was said about the vexed
question of irrigation. Isobel had made no changes
in her table arrangements other than to have a plate
laid for Mrs. Blake beside her father&#8217;s and another
for Blake beside her own.</p>
<p>The employ&eacute;s were too accustomed to Miss Chuckie
to be embarrassed by the presence of another lady,
and Blake put himself on familiar terms with them by
his first remarks. If his wealthy high-bred wife was
surprised to find herself seated at the same table with
common workmen, she betrayed no resentment over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the situation. Her perfect breeding was shown in the
unaffected simplicity of her manner, which was precisely
the same to the roughest man present as to her hostess.</p>
<p>Even had there been any indications of uncongeniality,
they must have been overcome by the presence of
Thomas Herbert Vincent Leslie Blake. The most unkempt,
hard-bitten bachelor present gazed upon the
majesty of babyhood with awed reverence and delight.
The silent Jap interrupted his serving to fetch a queer
rattle of ivory balls carved out one within the other.
This he cleansed with soap, peroxide and hot water,
in the presence of the honorable lady mother, before
presenting it to her infant with much smiling and hissing
insuckings of breath.</p>
<p>After supper all retired at an early hour, out of regard
for the weariness of Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>When she reappeared, late the next morning, she
learned that Knowles, Gowan and her husband had
ridden off together hours before. But Isobel and Ashton
seemed to have nothing else to do than to entertain
the mother and child. Mrs. Blake donned one of the
girl&#8217;s divided skirts and took her first lesson in riding
astride. There was no sidesaddle at the ranch, but
there was a surefooted old cow pony too wise and
spiritless for tricks, and therefore safe even for a less
experienced horsewoman than was Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>Knowles and Gowan and the engineer returned so
late that they found all the others at the supper table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Blake&#8217;s freshly sunburnt face was cheerful. Gowan&#8217;s
expression was as noncommittal as usual. But the
cowman&#8217;s forehead was furrowed with unrelieved suspense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Blake!&#8221; exclaimed Isobel. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell
us your report is unfavorable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid I can&#8217;t say, as yet,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
covered the ground pretty thoroughly for miles along
High Mesa and Deep Ca&ntilde;on. If the annual precipitation
here is what I estimate it from what your father
tells me, it would be possible to put in a drainage and
reservoir system that would store four thousand acre
feet. Except as an auxiliary system, however, it would
cost too much to be practicable. As for Deep Ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He turned to his wife. &#8220;Jenny, whatever else
happens, I must get you up to see that ca&ntilde;on. It&#8217;s
almost as grand and in some ways even more wonderful
than the Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must see it, by all means,&#8221; responded Mrs.
Blake. &#8220;I shall soon be able to ride up to it, Isobel
assures me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Within a few days,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;But, Mr.
Blake, pardon me&ndash;&ndash;How about the water in the
ca&ntilde;on? You surely see no way to lift it out over
the top of High Mesa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t even guess what can be done
until I have run a line of levels and found the depth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of the ca&ntilde;on. I tried to estimate it by dropping in
rocks and timing them, but we couldn&#8217;t see them strike
bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A line of levels? Will it take you long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a week; possibly more. If I had a transit
as well as my level, it would save time. However, I
can make out with the chain and compass I brought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake is to start running his levels in the
morning,&#8221; said Knowles. &#8220;Lafe, I&#8217;d like you to help
him as his rodman, if you have no objections. As
you&#8217;ve been an engineer, you can help him along
faster than Kid.&ndash;&ndash;You said one would do, Mr. Blake;
but if you need more, take all the men you want. The
sooner this thing is settled, the better it will suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner the better, Daddy!&#8221; agreed Isobel,
&#8220;that is, if our guests promise to not hurry away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall stay at least a month, if you wish us to,&#8221;
said Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months would be too short!&ndash;&ndash;And the
sooner we are over with this uncertainty&ndash;&ndash;Lafe,
you&#8217;ll do your utmost to help Mr. Blake, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; anything I can,&#8221; eagerly responded
Ashton.</p>
<p>Gowan&#8217;s face darkened at sight of the smile with
which the girl rewarded the tenderfoot. Yet instead
of sulking, he joined in the evening&#8217;s entertainment of
the guests with a zeal that agreeably surprised everyone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
His guitar playing won genuine praise from the
Blakes, though both were sophisticated and critical
music lovers.</p>
<p>Somewhat earlier than usual he rose to go, with the
excuse that he wished to consult Knowles about some
business with the owner of the adjoining range. The
cowman went out with him, and did not return. An
hour later Ashton took reluctant leave of Isobel, and
started for the bunkhouse. Half way across he was
met by his employer, who stopped before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody turning in, Lafe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at my suggestion, though,&#8221; replied Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon not. Mr. Blake and his lady are old
friends of yours, I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Blake is,&#8221; stated Ashton, with a touch of his
former arrogance. &#8220;We made mud-pies together, in
a hundred thousand dollar dooryard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted Knowles. &#8220;And her husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>The darkness hid Ashton&#8217;s face, but his voice betrayed
the sudden upwelling of his bitterness: &#8220;I
never heard of him until he&ndash;&ndash;until a little over three
years ago. I wish to Heaven he hadn&#8217;t taken part
in that bridge contest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Knowles in a casual tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing!&#8221; Ashton hastened to disclaim.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been talking with Miss Chuckie
about me, have you, Mr. Knowles?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only that I explained to her how I came to
be ruined&ndash;&ndash;to lose my fortune. You see, the circumstances
are such that I cannot very well say anything
against Blake; yet he was the cause&ndash;&ndash;it was owing
to something he did that I lost all&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;millions!
Curse him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve appeared friendly enough towards him,&#8221;
remarked Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&ndash;&ndash;I promised Miss Chuckie to try to forget
the past. But when I think of what I lost, all because
of him&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So-o!&#8221; considered the cowman. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s
more in what Kid says than I thought. He&#8217;s been
cross-questioning Blake all day. You know how little
Kid is given to gab. But from the time we started off
he kept after Blake like he was cutting out steers at
the round-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blake isn&#8217;t the kind you could get to tell anything
against himself,&#8221; asserted Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that may be. All his talk today struck me
as being straightforward and outspoken. But Kid has
been drawing inferences. He keeps hammering at it
that Blake must be in thick with his father-in-law, and
that all millionaires round-up their money in ways that
would make a rustler go off and shoot himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Business is business,&#8221; replied Ashton with all his
old cynicism. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not say that H. V. Leslie is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
crooked, but I never knew of his coming out of a deal
second best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at any rate, it&#8217;s white of Blake to tell us
beforehand what he intends to do if he sees a chance of
a practical project.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he told you everything?&#8221; scoffed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about his offer to drop the whole matter and
not go into it at all?&#8221; rejoined Knowles.</p>
<p>Ashton hesitated to reply. For one thing, he was
momentarily nonplused, and, for another, the Blakes
had treated him as a gentleman. But a fresh upwelling
of bitterness dulled his conscience and sharpened
his wits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may have been to throw you off your guard,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Blake is deep, and he has had old Leslie to
coach him ever since he married Genevieve. He could
have laid his plans,&ndash;&ndash;looked over the ground, and
found out just what are your rights here,&ndash;&ndash;all without
your suspecting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not so sure&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you told him what lands you have deeds
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but if he knows as much about the West as I
figure he does, he can guess it. Fence every swallow
of get-at-able water to be found on my range this time
of year, and you won&#8217;t have to dig a posthole off of
land I hold in fee simple. Plum Creek sinks just below
where Dry Fork junctions.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t have <i>all</i> the water?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton
incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, every drop to be found outside Deep Ca&ntilde;on
this time of year. There&#8217;s my seven and a half mile
string of quarter-sections blanketing Plum Creek from
the springs to down below Dry Fork, and five quarter-sections
covering all the waterholes. That makes up
five sections. A bunch of tenderfeet came in here,
years ago, and pre&euml;mpted all the quarter-sections with
water on them. Got their patents from the government.
Then the Utes stampeded them clean out of
the country, and I bought up their titles at a fair
figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you own even that splendid pool up where I
had my camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything wet on this range that a cow or hawss
can get to, this time of year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton considered, and advised craftily: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tell him this. Does Miss Chuckie know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows I have five sections, and that most of
it is on Plum Creek. I don&#8217;t think anything has ever
been said to her about the waterholes. But why not
tell Blake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? Even if he finds a way to get at
the water in Deep Ca&ntilde;on, he will first have to bore his
tunnel. He and his construction gang must have water
to drink and for their engines while they are carrying
out his plans. You can lie low, and, when the right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
time comes, get out an injunction against their trespassing
on your land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s not a bad idea. The best I could figure
was that they might need one of my waterholes for a
reservoir site. But why not call him when he first takes
a hand?&#8221; asked Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you should not show your cards until you have
to,&#8221; replied Ashton. &#8220;With all Leslie&#8217;s money against
you, it might be hard to get your injunction if they
knew of your plans. But if you wait until they have
their men, machinery and materials on the ground, you
will have them where they must buy you out at your
own terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James!&#8221; commented Knowles. &#8220;Talk
about business sharps!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Leslie&#8217;s office for a time,&#8221; explained Ashton.
&#8220;Your interests are Miss Chuckie&#8217;s interests.
I&#8217;m for her&ndash;&ndash;first, last, and all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m. Then I guess I can count on you as sure
as on Gowan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can. I am going to try my best to win your
daughter, Mr. Knowles. She&#8217;s a lady&ndash;&ndash;the loveliest
girl I ever met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt about that. What&#8217;s more, she&#8217;s got
grit and brains. That&#8217;s why I tell you now, as I&#8217;ve
told Kid, it&#8217;s for her to decide on the man she&#8217;s going
to make happy. If he&#8217;s square and white, that&#8217;s all
I ask.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About my helping Blake with his levels,&#8221; Ashton
rather hastily changed the subject. &#8220;I am in your employ&ndash;&ndash;and
so is he, for that matter. Don&#8217;t you think
I have a right to keep you posted on all his plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&ndash;&ndash;yes. But he as much as says he will tell
them himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he will, and perhaps he won&#8217;t, Mr.
Knowles. I&#8217;ve told you what Leslie is like; and Blake
is his son-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not so sure. You and Kid, between
you, have shaken my judgment of the man. It can&#8217;t do
any harm to watch him, and I&#8217;ll be obliged to you for
doing it. If it comes to a fight against him and the
millions of backing he has, I want a fair deal and&ndash;&ndash;But,
Lord! what if we&#8217;re making all this fuss over
nothing? It doesn&#8217;t stand to reason that there&#8217;s any
way to get the water out of Deep Ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a week or so,&#8221; cautioned Ashton. &#8220;In my
opinion, Blake already sees a possibility.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>LEVELS AND SLANTS</h3>
</div>
<p>At sunrise the next morning Blake screwed his
level on its tripod and set up the instrument about
a hundred yards away from the ranch house. Ashton
held the level rod for him on a spike driven into
the foot of the nearest post of the front porch. Blake
called the spike a bench-mark. For convenience of
determining the relative heights of the points along his
lines of levels, he designated this first &#8220;bench&#8221; in his
fieldbook as &#8220;elevation 1,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the porch he ran the line of level &#8220;readings&#8221;
up the slope to the top of the divide between Plum
Creek and Dry Fork and from there towards the waterhole
on Dry Fork. At noon Isobel and Mrs. Blake
drove out to them in the buckboard, bringing a hot meal
in an improvised fireless-cooker.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we came West to rough-it!&#8221; groaned Blake,
his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can camp at the waterhole where Lafe did,
and I&#8217;ll send Kid out for that bobcat,&#8221; suggested the
girl. &#8220;You could roast him, hair and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! roast Gowan?&#8221; protested Blake. &#8220;Let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
me tell you, Miss Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;you and my wife and Ashton
may like him that much, but I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not worry, Mr. Tenderfoot,&#8221; the girl
flashed back at him. &#8220;Whenever it comes to a hot
time, Kid always gets in the first fire, without waiting
to be told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton. &#8220;Maybe
you haven&#8217;t noticed this hole in my hat, Mrs. Blake.
He put a bullet through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s right over your temple, Lafayette!&#8221; replied
Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lafe was lifting his some-berero to me, and Kid
did it to haze him&ndash;&ndash;only a joke, you know,&#8221; explained
Isobel. &#8220;Of course Lafe was in no danger. It was
different, though, when somebody&ndash;&ndash;we think it was
his thieving guide&ndash;&ndash;took several rifle shots at him.
Tell them about it, Lafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton gave an account of the murderous attack,
more than once checking himself in a natural tendency
to embellish the exciting details.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! What if the man should come back and shoot
at us?&#8221; shuddered Mrs. Blake, drawing her baby close
in her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear of that,&#8221; asserted Isobel. &#8220;Kid found
that he had fled towards the railroad. That proves it
must have been the guide. He would never dare come
back after such a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he should, I always carry my rifle, as you see,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
remarked Ashton; adding, with a touch of bravado,
&#8220;I made him run once, and I would again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Miss Chuckie is sure he will not come
back,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy anyone shooting
at me that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Timid Mr. Blake!&#8221; teased the girl. &#8220;Genevieve
has been telling me how you faced a lion with only a
bow and arrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had to,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;He&#8217;d have jumped on me
if I had turned or backed off.&ndash;&ndash;Speaking about
camping at that waterhole, I believe we&#8217;ll do it, Ashton,
if it&#8217;s the same thing to you. It would save the
time that would be lost coming and going to the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Save time?&#8221; repeated Isobel. &#8220;Then of course
we&#8217;ll bring out a tent and camp kit for you tomorrow.
Genevieve and I can ride or drive up to the waterhole
each day, to picnic with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be delightful,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ride on ahead and wait for us in the shade,&#8221;
said her husband. &#8220;We&#8217;ll knock off for the day when
we reach that dolerite dike above the waterhole.&ndash;&ndash;If
you are ready, Ashton, we&#8217;ll peg along.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started off to set up his level as briskly as at
dawn, though the midday sun was so hot that he had
to shade the instrument with his handkerchief to keep
the air-bubble from outstretching its scale. His wife
and the girl drove on up Dry Fork to the waterhole.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake was outstretched on her back, fast asleep,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and Isobel was playing with the baby under the adjoining
tree, when at last the surveyors came up on the
other side of the creek and ended their day&#8217;s run with
the establishment of a bench-mark on the top of the
dike above the pool. Blake seemed as fresh as in
the morning. He took a moderate drink of water
dipped up in the brim of his hat, and without wakening
his wife, sat down beside her to &#8220;figure up&#8221; his
fieldbook.</p>
<p>Ashton had come down to the pool panting from
heat and exertion. It was the first time that he had
walked more than half a mile since coming to the
ranch, for he had immediately fallen into the cowboy
practice of saddling a horse to go even short distances.
He had his reward for his work when, having soused
his hot head in the pool and drunk his fill, he came up
to rest in the shade of Isobel&#8217;s tree. Very considerately
the baby fell asleep. To avoid disturbing him and
his mother, the young couple talked in low tones and
half whispers very conducive to intimacy.</p>
<p>Ashton did his utmost to improve his opportunity.
Without openly speaking his love, he allowed it to
appear in his every look and intonation. The girl
met the attack with banter and raillery and adroit shiftings
of the conversation whenever his ardent inferences
became too obvious. Yet her evasion and her teasing
could not always mask her maidenly pleasure over his
adoration of her loveliness, and an occasional blush betrayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
to him that his wooing was not altogether unwelcome.</p>
<p>He was in the seventh heaven when Mrs. Blake
awoke from her health-giving sleep and her husband
closed his fieldbook. The girl promptly dashed her
suitor back to earth by dropping him for the engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake! You can&#8217;t have figured it out already?&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;What do you find?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only an &#8216;if,&#8217; Miss Chuckie,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;If
water can be stored or brought by ditch to this elevation,
practically all Dry Mesa can be irrigated. Our
bench-mark there on the dike is more than two hundred
feet above that spike we drove into your porch
post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you&#8217;ve found out today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All for today,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I could have left
this line of levels until later, but I thought I might as
well get through with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have run them if you had thought
they would be useless,&#8221; she stated, perceiving the point
with intuitive acuteness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to clean up my work as I go along,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;If you wish to know, I have thought of a
possible way to get water enough for the whole mesa.
It depends on two &#8216;ifs.&#8217; I shall be certain as to one
of them within the next two days. The other is the
question of the depth of Deep Ca&ntilde;on. If I had a
transit, I could determine that by a vertical angle,&ndash;&ndash;triangulation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
As it is, I probably shall have to go
down to the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go down to the bottom of Deep Ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; cried
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered in a matter-of-course tone. &#8220;A
big ravine runs clear down to the bottom, up beyond
where your father said you first met Ashton. I think
it is possible to get down that gulch.&ndash;&ndash;Suppose we
hitch up? We&#8217;ll make the ranch just about supper-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton hastened to bring in the picketed horses.
When they were harnessed Isobel fetched the sleeping
baby and handed him to his mother; but she did not
take the seat beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You drive, Lafe,&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
ride behind with Mr. Blake. It&#8217;s such fun bouncing.&#8221;</p>
<p>All protested in vain against this odd whim. The
girl plumped herself in on the rear end of the buckboard
and dangled her slender feet with the gleefulness
of a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Blake will catch me if I go to jolt off,&#8221; she
declared.</p>
<p>The engineer nodded with responsive gayety and
seated himself beside her. As the buckboard rattled
away over the rough sod, they made as merry over
their jolts and bounces as a pair of school-children on
a hayrack party.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake sought to divert Ashton from his disappointment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
but he had ears only for the laughing,
chatting couple behind him. The fact that Blake was
a married man did not prevent the lover from giving
way to jealous envy. Chancing to look around as he
warned the hilarious pair of a gully, he saw the girl
grasp Blake&#8217;s shoulder. Natural as was the act, his
envy flared up in hot resentment. Except on their
drive to Stockchute, she had always avoided even
touching his hand with her finger tips; yet now she
clung to the engineer with a grasp as familiar as that
of an affectionate child. Nor did she release her clasp
until they were some yards beyond the gully.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake had seen not only the expression that
betrayed Ashton&#8217;s anger but also the action that caused
it. She raised her fine eyebrows; but meeting Ashton&#8217;s
significant glance, she sought to pass over the incident
with a smile. He refused to respond. All during the
remainder of the drive he sat in sullen silence. Genevieve
bent over her baby. Behind them the unconscious
couple continued in their mirthful enjoyment of
each other and the ride.</p>
<p>When the party reached the ranch, the girl must
have perceived Ashton&#8217;s moroseness had she not first
caught sight of her father. He was standing outside
the front porch, his eyes fixed upon the corner post
in a perplexed stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Daddy,&#8221; she called, &#8220;what is it? You
look as you do when playing chess with Kid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid it&#8217;s something that&#8217;ll annoy Mr. Blake,&#8221;
replied the cowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Blake, who was handing his
wife from the buckboard.</p>
<p>As the engineer faced Knowles, Gowan sauntered
around the far corner of the house. At sight of the
ladies he paused to adjust his neckerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t understand it, Mr. Blake,&#8221; said the cowman.
&#8220;Somebody has pulled out that spike you drove in
here this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pulled the spike?&#8221; repeated Gowan, coming forward
to stare at the post. &#8220;That shore is a joke.
The Jap&#8217;s building a new henhouse. Must be short
of nails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Knowles. &#8220;I forgot to order
them for him. I&#8217;m mighty sorry, Mr. Blake. But
of course the little brown cuss didn&#8217;t know what he
was meddling with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumping Jehosaphat!&#8221; ejaculated Gowan. &#8220;That
shore is mighty hard luck! I reckon pulling that
spike turns your line of levels adrift like knocking out
the picket-pin of an uneasy hawss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake burst into a hearty laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine
metaphor, Mr. Gowan. But it does not happen to
fit the case. It would not matter if the spike-hole had
been pulled out and the post along with it, so far as
concerns this line of levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; muttered Gowan, his lean jaw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
dropping slack. He glowered as if chagrined at the
engineer&#8217;s laughter at his mistake.</p>
<p>Without heeding the puncher&#8217;s look, Blake began to
tell Knowles the result of his day&#8217;s work. While he
was speaking, they went into the house after his wife
and the girl, leaving Gowan and Ashton alone.
Equally sullen and resentful, the rivals exchanged stares
of open hostility. Ashton pointed a derisive finger at
the spike-hole in the post.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hole ... and the post along with it!&#8217;&#8221; he repeated
Blake&#8217;s words. &#8220;On bridge work it might
have caused some trouble. But a preliminary line of
levels&ndash;&ndash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! A Jap should have known better&ndash;&ndash;or
even a yap!&#8221; With a supercilious shrug, he
swung back into the buckboard and drove up to the
corral.</p>
<p>Gowan&#8217;s right hand had dropped to his hip. Slowly
it came up and joined the other hand in rolling a thick
Mexican cigarette. But the puncher did not light his
&#8220;smoke.&#8221; He looked at the spike-hole in the post,
scowled, and went back around the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>METAL AND METTLE</h3>
</div>
<p>At dawn Blake and Ashton drove up to the waterhole
on Dry Fork with their camp equipment.
There they left the outfit in the buckboard and proceeded
with the line of levels on up the creek bed into
the gorge from which it issued.</p>
<p>For more than a mile they carried the levels over
the bowlders of the gradually sloping bottom of that
stupendous gash in the mountain side. So far the work
was fairly easy. At last, however, they came to the
place where the bed of the gulch suddenly tilted upward
at a sharp angle and climbed the tremendous
heights to the top of High Mesa in sheer ascents and
cliff-like ledges. Blake established a bench-mark at
the foot of the acclivity, and came forward beside Ashton
to peer up the Titanic chute between the dizzy
precipices. From where they stood to the head of
the gulch was fully four thousand feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; asked the engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is where your line ends,&#8221; answered Ashton,
and he rolled a cigarette. He had been anything
but agreeable since their start from the ranch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We of course can&#8217;t go up with the level and rod,&#8221;
said Blake, smiling at the absurdity of the suggestion.
&#8220;Still, we might possibly chain it to the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged. &#8220;I fail to see the need of risking
my neck to climb this goat stairway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed Blake, ignoring his companion&#8217;s
ill humor. &#8220;Kindly take back the level and get out
the chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton started off without replying. Blake looked
at the young man&#8217;s back with a regretful, half-puzzled
expression. But he quickly returned to the business
in hand. He laid the level rod on a rock and inclined
it at the same steep pitch as the uptilt of the gorge bottom.
Over the lower end of this he held a plumb bob,
and took the angle between the perpendicular line of
the bob-string and the inclined line of the rod with a
small protractor that he carried in his notebook. The
angle measured over fifty degrees from the horizontal.</p>
<p>Having thus determined the angle of inclination, the
engineer picked a likely line of ascent and started to
climb the gulch chute. He went up in rapid rushes,
with the ease and surefootedness of a coolheaded, steel-muscled
climber. He stopped frequently, not because
of weariness or of lack of breath, but to test the structure
and hardness of the rocks with a small magnifying
glass and the butt of his pocket knife.</p>
<p>At last, nearly a thousand feet up, his ascent was
stopped by a sheer hundred-foot cliff. He had seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
it beetling above him and knew beforehand that he
could not hope to scale such a precipice; yet he clambered
up to it, still examining the rock with minute
care. As he walked across the waterworn shelf at the
foot of the sheer cliff, his eye was caught by a wide
seam of quartz in the side wall of the gulch.</p>
<p>Going on over to the vein, he looked at it in several
places through his magnifying glass. Everywhere
little yellow specks showed in the semi-translucent
quartz. He drew back across the gorge to examine
the trend of the vein. It ran far outward and upward,
and in no place was it narrower than where it
disappeared under the bed of the gorge.</p>
<p>His lips pursed in a prolonged, soundless whistle.
But he did not linger. Immediately after he had estimated
the visible length and dip of the seam, he began
his descent. Arriving at the foot without accident,
he picked up the level rod and swung away down the
gulch.</p>
<p>He saw nothing of Ashton until he had come all
the distance down across the valley to the dike above
the pool. His assistant was in the grove below,
assiduously helping Miss Knowles to erect a tent that
the girl had improvised from a tarpaulin. Genevieve
and Thomas Herbert were interesting themselves in
the contents of the kit-box. The two ladies had ridden
up to the camp on horseback, Isobel carrying the baby.</p>
<p>When Blake came striding down to them, the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
left Ashton and ran to meet him, her eyes beaming with
affectionate welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has kept you so long?&#8221; she called. &#8220;Lafe
says the gulch is absolutely unclimbable. I could have
told you so, beforehand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. I tried it, but had to quit,&#8221; replied
Blake, engulfing her outstretched hand in his
big palm.</p>
<p>When he would have released her, she caught his
fingers and held fast, so that they came down to his
wife hand in hand. Oblivious of Ashton&#8217;s frown, the
girl dimpled at Mrs. Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he is, Genevieve,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have him
corralled for the rest of the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; replied Blake, stooping to pick up his
chuckling son. &#8220;We can&#8217;t knock off now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you cannot continue your levels?&#8221; asked his
wife. &#8220;From what Lafayette told us, we thought you
would not start in again until after lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more levels until tomorrow,&#8221; said Blake.
&#8220;But I must settle one of my big &#8216;ifs&#8217; by night. To
do it, Ashton and I will have to go up on High Mesa
and measure a line. There&#8217;s still two hours till noon.
We&#8217;ll borrow your saddle ponies, Miss Chuckie, and
start at once, if Jenny will put us up a bite of lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately, Tom,&#8221; assented Mrs. Blake, delighted
at the opportunity to serve her big husband.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When shall we take Genevieve to see the ca&ntilde;on?&#8221;
asked the girl. &#8220;I am sure she can ride up safely on
old Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have only the two saddle horses today,&#8221; replied
Blake. &#8220;If our measurement settles that &#8216;if&#8217;
one way, I shall start a line of levels up the mountain
tomorrow morning, if the other way, any irrigation
project is out of the question, and we shall go up to
the ca&ntilde;on merely as a sightseeing party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; sighed the girl. &#8220;&#8216;If!&#8217; &#8216;if&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I do so
hope it turns out to be the last one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake looked at her with a quizzical smile. &#8220;Perhaps
you would not, Miss Chuckie, if you could see
all the results of a successful water system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, turning our range into farms for hundreds
of irrigationists,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I suppose I am
selfish, but I am thinking of what it would mean to
Daddy. Just consider how it will affect us. For
years this land has been our own for miles and miles!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we shall see,&#8221; said Blake, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Lafe, if you&#8217;ll
help me saddle up and help Mr. Blake rush up to do
that measuring, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll be ever so grateful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Though all the more resentful at Blake over having
to leave her company, Ashton eagerly sprang forward
to help the girl saddle the ponies. When they were
ready, she filled his canteen for him and took a sip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
from it &#8220;for luck.&#8221; Genevieve had packed an ample
lunch in a gamebag, along with her husband&#8217;s linked
steel-wire surveyor&#8217;s chain.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after Blake&#8217;s arrival, he handed the
baby to its mother and swung into the saddle. Ashton
had already mounted, fired by a kind glance from
the girl&#8217;s forget-me-not eyes. In his zeal, he led the
way at a gallop around the craggy hill and across the
intervening valley to the escarpment of High Mesa.
Had not Blake checked him, he would have forced the
pace on up the mountain side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; called the engineer. &#8220;We want to
make haste slowly. That buckskin you&#8217;re on isn&#8217;t so
young as he has been, and my pony has to lug around
two hundred pounds. We&#8217;ll get back sooner by being
moderate. Besides you don&#8217;t wish to knock up old
Buck. He is about the only one of these jumpy cow
ponies that is safe for Jenny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; admitted Ashton. &#8220;Suppose you set
the pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped to let Blake pass him, and trailed behind
up the mountain side. He had headed into a draw.
The engineer at once turned and began zigzagging up
the steep side of the ridge that thrust out into the valley
between the draw and the gulch of Dry Fork. At the
stiffest places he jumped off and led his pony. None
too willingly, Ashton followed the example set by his
companion. There were some places where he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
not have avoided so doing&ndash;&ndash;ledges that the old buckskin,
despite his years of mountain service, could hardly
scramble up under an empty saddle.</p>
<p>Long before they reached the point of the ridge,
Ashton was panting and sweating, and his handsome
face was red from exertion and anger. But his indignation
at being misguided up so difficult a line of
ascent received a damper when he reached the lower
end of the ridge crest. Blake, who had waited patiently
for him to clamber up the last sharp slope, gave
him a cheerful nod and pointed to the long but fairly
easy incline of the ridge crest.</p>
<p>&#8220;In mountain climbing, always take your stiffest
ground first, when you can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can jog
along pretty fast now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They mounted and rode up the ridge, much of the
time at a jog trot. Before long they came to the top
of High Mesa, and galloped across to one of the ridges
that lay parallel with Deep Ca&ntilde;on. Climbing the
ridge, they found themselves looking over into a
ravine that ran down to the right to join another ravine
from the opposite direction, at the head of Dry Fork
Gulch. Blake turned and rode to the left along the
ridge, until he found a place where they could cross
the ravine. The still air was reverberating with the
muffled roar of Deep Ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>From the ridge on the other side of the ravine, they
could look down between the scattered pines to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
gaping chasm of the stupendous ca&ntilde;on. But Blake
rode to the right along the summit of the ridge until
they came opposite the head of Dry Fork Gulch.
Here he flung the reins over his pony&#8217;s head, and dismounted.
Ashton was about to do the same when he
caught sight of a wolf slinking away like a gray shadow
up the farther ravine. He reached for his rifle, and
for the first time noticed that he had failed to bring
it along. In his haste to start from camp he had left
it in the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sacre!</i>&#8221; he petulantly exclaimed. &#8220;There goes
twenty-five dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Blake. He looked and
caught a glimpse of the wolf just as it vanished. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left my rifle in camp, curse the luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep cool,&#8221; advised Blake. &#8220;It&#8217;s only twenty-five
dollars, and you might have missed anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with my automatic,&#8221; snapped Ashton.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t sneer about the money. You&#8217;ve seen
times when you&#8217;d have been glad of a chance at half
the amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; gravely agreed the engineer.
&#8220;What&#8217;s more, I realize that it is far harder for you
than it ever was for me. I want to tell you I admire
the way you have stood your loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; burst out the younger man. &#8220;I want
to tell <i>you</i> I don&#8217;t admire the way you ruined me&ndash;&ndash;babbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
to my father&ndash;&ndash;when you promised to keep
still! You sneak!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake looked into the other&#8217;s furious face with no
shade of change in his grave gaze. &#8220;I have never
said a word to your father against you,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;then how, after all this time&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; stammered
Ashton, even in his anger unable to disbelieve
the engineer&#8217;s quiet statement. He was disconcerted
only for the moment. Again he flared hotly: &#8220;But
if you didn&#8217;t, old Leslie must have! It&#8217;s all the
same!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is not the same,&#8221; corrected Blake. &#8220;As
for my father-in-law, if he said anything about&ndash;&ndash;the
past, I feel sure it was not with intention to hurt your
interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt my interests! You know I am utterly
ruined!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I know you are not ruined. You
have lost a large allowance, and a will has been made
cutting you off from a great many millions that you expected
to inherit. But you have landed square on your
feet; you have a pretty good job, and you are stronger
and healthier than you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you break up Mr. Knowles&#8217; range with your
irrigation schemes, I stand to lose my job. You know
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the project proves to be feasible, I shall offer
you a position on the works,&#8221; said Blake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t try to bribe me!&#8221; retorted Ashton.
&#8220;I&#8217;m working for Mr. Knowles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he directed you to help me with this survey,&#8221;
replied the engineer, with imperturbable good nature.
&#8220;The next move is to chain across to the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled his surveyor&#8217;s chain from the bag and descended
the ridge to an out-jutting rock above the head
of the tremendous gorge in the mountain side. Ashton
followed him down. Blake handed him the front
end of the chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lead,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll line you, as I know
where to strike the nearest point on the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton sullenly started up the ridge, and the measurement
began. As Blake required only a rough approximation,
they soon crossed the ridge and chained
down through the trees to the edge of Deep Ca&ntilde;on.
Ashton was astonished at the shortness of the distance.
The ca&ntilde;on at this point ran towards the mesa escarpment
as if it had originally intended to drive through
into Dry Fork Gulch, but twisted sharp about and
curved back across the plateau. Even Blake was surprised
at the measurement. It was only a little over
two thousand feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noticed this place when out with Mr. Knowles and
Gowan,&#8221; he remarked, gazing down into the abyss with
keen appreciation of its awful grandeur. &#8220;They told
me it is the nearest that the ca&ntilde;on comes to the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
of the mesa, until it breaks out, thirty or forty miles
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&ndash;&ndash;how about that &#8216;if&#8217; you said this measurement
would settle?&#8221; asked Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton looked at his watch, frowning over the
evasive reply. &#8220;It&#8217;s two-ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll figure on the proposition while we eat lunch,&#8221;
said Blake. &#8220;I can answer you better regarding that
&#8216;if&#8217; when I have done some calculating. Luckily I
climbed up to examine the rock in the gulch.&#8221; He
smiled quizzically at his companion. &#8220;You were right
as to its being unclimbable; but I found out even more
than I expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton silently took the bag from him and arranged
the lunch and his canteen on a rock under a pine. The
engineer figured and drew little diagrams in his fieldbook
while he ate his sandwiches. Ashton had half
drained the canteen on the way up the mountain. Before
sitting down Blake had rinsed out his mouth and
taken a few swallows of water. After eating, he
started to take another drink, noticed his companion&#8217;s
hot dry face, and stopped after a single sip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you need it more than I do,&#8221; he remarked, as
he rose to his feet. &#8220;Time to start. I wish to go
around and down the mountain on the other side of
the gulch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How about the&ndash;&ndash;the &#8216;if&#8217;?&#8221; inquired Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed,&#8221; answered Blake. &#8220;There now is only
one left. If that comes out the same way, Dry Mesa
will have good cause to change its name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tunnel through from the gulch to the
ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and I shall do so&ndash;&ndash;if Deep Ca&ntilde;on is not too
deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it is a thousand feet below Dry Mesa!&#8221;
said Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the circumstances,&#8221; Blake replied to the fervent
declaration, &#8220;I am glad to hear you say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared, but could detect no sarcasm in the
other&#8217;s smile of commendation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A SHOT IN THE DUSK</h3>
</div>
<p>They returned to their grazing ponies, and at
once started the descent of the mountain, after
crossing the ravine where they had seen the wolf.
Blake chose a route that brought them down into the
valley above the waterhole shortly before five o&#8217;clock.
They cantered the remaining distance along the wide,
gravelly wash of the creek bed to the dike.</p>
<p>Looking down from the dike, they saw that Knowles
and Gowan had come up the creek and were waiting for
them in company with the ladies. Ashton set spurs to
his horse and dashed across above the pool, to descend
the slope to the party. Blake descended on the other
side, to water his horse and slake his own thirst.</p>
<p>To Ashton&#8217;s chagrin, Isobel joined Genevieve in
hastening to meet the engineer. He rode down beside
the two men and jumped off to follow the ladies. But
Gowan sprang before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mr. Knowles wants your
report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll oblige us, Lafe,&#8221; added the cowman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty much worked up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have cause to be!&#8221; replied Ashton. &#8220;He
says the only question left is whether the water in the
ca&ntilde;on is not at too low a level. We measured across
from the creek gulch to the ca&ntilde;on. A tunnel is practicable,
he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through all that mountain?&#8221; scoffed Gowan.
&#8220;It&#8217;s solid rock, clean through. It would take him
a hundred years to burrow a hole like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know nothing of engineering and its tools.
We now have electric drills that will eat into granite
like cheese,&#8221; condescendingly explained Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I don&#8217;t know that? But just you try to
figure out how he&#8217;s going to get his electricity for his
drills,&#8221; retorted Gowan.</p>
<p>Without stopping for his disconcerted rival to reply,
he turned his back on him and started towards
Isobel. The girl was running up from the pool, her
face almost pitiful with disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy!&#8221; she called, &#8220;Mr. Blake says that if
the water in the ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t tell me, honey. I know already,&#8221; broke
in her father, hastening to meet her.</p>
<p>She flung her arms about his neck, and sobbed
brokenly: &#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m so sorry for you, D-Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there now!&#8221; he soothed, awkwardly patting
her back. &#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t like you to cry before you&#8217;re
hurt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&ndash;&ndash;you! not me. It doesn&#8217;t matter about
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it, though! But I&#8217;m not hurt either, as
yet. It&#8217;s a long ways from being a sure thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the way down to the bottom of Deep Ca&ntilde;on!&#8221;
put in Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then some!&#8221; added Gowan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve hit on
another &#8216;if,&#8217; Miss Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have? Oh, Kid, tell us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this: How&#8217;s he going to get electricity to
dig his tunnel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake was coming up from the pool, with his baby
in one arm and his wife clinging fondly to the other.
He met the coldly exultant glance of Gowan, and
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only question regarding the power is one of
cost, Mr. Gowan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no coal near
enough to be hauled. But gasolene is not bulky. If
there was water power to generate electricity, a tunnel
could be bored at half the cost I have figured. The
point is that there is no water power available, nor will
there be until the tunnel is finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You talk about finishing the tunnel?
Didn&#8217;t you say it is still uncertain about the water?&#8221;
demanded Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was merely explaining to Mr. Gowan,&#8221; replied
Blake. &#8220;The question he raised is one of the factors
in our problem as to whether an irrigation project is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
practicable. We now know that we have the land for
it, the tunnel site, the reservoir site&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he pointed to
the valley above the dike&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and I have figured that
the cost of construction would not be excessive. All
that remains is to determine if we have the water. I
have already explained that this will require a descent
into the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that that will decide it, one way or the
other?&#8221; queried Knowles, his forehead creased with
deep lines of foreboding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Blake. &#8220;I regret that you feel as
you do about it. Consider what it would mean to
hundreds, yes, thousands of people, if this mesa were
watered. I assure you that you, too, would benefit
by the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for any such benefit, Mr. Blake.
I&#8217;ve been a cowman for twenty-five years. I want to
keep my range until the time comes for me to take
the long trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be hard to change,&#8221; agreed the engineer.
&#8220;However, the point now is to find what Deep Ca&ntilde;on
has to tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still think you can go down it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if I have ropes, a two-pound hammer, and
some iron pins; railroad spikes and picket-pins would
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to rope the rocks and pull them up for
steps?&#8221; asked Gowan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall need two or three hundred feet of half-inch
manila,&#8221; said Blake, ignoring the sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may have it at Stockchute,&#8221; said Knowles.
&#8220;Kid, you can drive over with the wagon and fetch
Mr. Blake all the rope and other things he wants.
I can&#8217;t stand this waiting much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no time lost,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;It will
take Ashton and me all of tomorrow to carry a line
of levels up the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why need you do that, Tom?&#8221; asked his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, why, if all that&#8217;s left is to go down into the
ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; added Isobel, dabbing the tears from her
wet eyes.</p>
<p>Ashton thrust in an answer before Blake could
speak. &#8220;We must see how high the upper mesa is
above this one, Miss Chuckie, and then compare the
difference of altitude with the depth of the ca&ntilde;on, to
see whether its bottom is above or below the bottom
of the gulch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;measure up and then down, to see which
way is longest,&#8221; said Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; broke in Knowles. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have
to be starting now to get home by dark. If you think
you can trust me with that young man, I&#8217;d like the
honor of packing him all the way in. I&#8217;ve toted
calves for miles, so I guess I can hold onto a baby
if I use both hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have him!&#8221; replied Genevieve, smiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
like a daughter as she met the look in his grave eyes.
&#8220;Tom, give Thomas to Mr. Knowles&ndash;&ndash;when he is
safe in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Gowan cracked a smile at this cautious qualification.
He hastened to bring Isobel&#8217;s horse and hold
him for her&ndash;&ndash;which gave Ashton the opportunity to
help her mount. Both services were needless, but she
rewarded each eager servitor with a dimpled smile.
When Blake handed the baby up to Knowles, his wife,
untroubled by mock modesty, gave him a loving kiss.
He lifted her bodily into the saddle, and she rode off
with her three companions.</p>
<p>Isobel, however, wheeled within the first few yards,
and came back for a parting word: &#8220;You can expect
us quite early tomorrow. We will overtake you
on your way up the mountain. I wish Genevieve to
see the ca&ntilde;on. Good night&ndash;&ndash;Pleasant dreams!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had addressed Ashton, but her last smile was
for Blake, and it was undisguisedly affectionate. As
she loped away after the others, Ashton frowned, and,
picking up his rifle, started off up the valley. Blake
was staring after the girl with a wondering look. He
turned to cast a quizzical glance at the back of the
resentful lover.</p>
<p>When the latter had disappeared around the hill,
the engineer took the frying pan and walked up into
the creek bed above the dike. After going some distance
over the gravel bars, he came to a place where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
swirl of the last freshet had gouged a hole almost
to bedrock. Scooping a panful of sand and gravel
from the bottom of the hole, he went back and squatted
down beside the pool within easy reach of the water.</p>
<p>He picked the larger pebbles from the pan, added
water, and began to swirl the contents around with a
circular motion. Each turn flirted some of the sand
and water over the pan&#8217;s beveled edge. Every little
while he renewed the water. At last the pan&#8217;s contents
were reduced to a half dozen, irregular, dirty,
little lumps and a handful of &#8220;black sand&#8221; in which
gleamed numbers of yellow particles.</p>
<p>Blake put the nuggets into his pocket and threw
the rest out into the pool. He returned to the tent
and sat down to re-check his level-book and his calculations
on the approximate cost of the tunnel. Sundown
found him still figuring; but when twilight faded
into dusk, he put away his fieldbook and started a
fire for supper.</p>
<p>He was in the act of setting on a pan of bacon when,
without the slightest warning, a bullet cut the knot of
the loose neckerchief under his downbent chin. In the
same instant that he heard the ping of the shot he
pitched sideways and flattened himself on the ground
with the chuck-box between him and the fire. A roll
and a quick crawl took him into the underbrush beyond
the circle of firelight. No second bullet followed
him in his amazingly swift movements. He lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
motionless, listening intently, but no sound broke the
stillness of the evening except the distant wail of a
coyote and the hoot of an owl.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, and still the engineer waited.
The dusk deepened into darkness. At last a heavy
footfall sounded up on the dike. Blake rose, and
slipping silently to the tent, groped about until he
found a heavy iron picket-pin.</p>
<p>Someone came down the slope and kicked his way
petulantly through the bushes to the dying fire. He
threw on an armful of brush. The light of the up-blazing
flame showed Ashton standing beside the
chuck-box, rifle in hand. But he dropped the weapon
to pick up the overturned frying pan, which lay at his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Blake!&#8221; he sang out irritably. &#8220;I supposed
you&#8217;d have supper waiting. Haven&#8217;t turned in
this early, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Blake, and he came forward, carelessly
swinging the picket-pin. &#8220;Thought I saw a
coyote sneaking about, and tried to trick him into coming
close enough for me to nail him with this pin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that!&#8221; scoffed Ashton. &#8220;But it would do
as well as my rifle. I took a shot at a wolf, and then
the mechanism jammed. I can&#8217;t get it to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fired a shot?&#8221; asked Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Was it too far off for you to hear? I
circled all around these hills.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I heard it,&#8221; replied Blake, looking close into
the other&#8217;s sullen face. &#8220;You may not have been
as far away as you thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was far enough,&#8221; grumbled Ashton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
walked till I&#8217;m hungry as a shark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realize that you want to be careful how
you shoot with these high-power rifles?&#8221; asked Blake.
&#8220;They carry a mile or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve carried mine more than that, and <i>it</i> won&#8217;t
carry an inch,&#8221; complained Ashton. &#8220;Wish you would
see if you can fix it, while I get on some bacon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake took his scrutinizing gaze from his companion&#8217;s
face, and picked up the rifle. Ashton showed
plainly that he was tired and hungry and very irritable,
but there was no trace of guilt in his look or
manner. While he hurriedly prepared supper, Blake
took apart the mechanism of the rifle. He discovered
the trouble at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is easy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nothing broken&ndash;&ndash;just
a screw loose. Have you been monkeying with the
parts, to see how they work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t care a hang how they work. What
gets me is that they didn&#8217;t work!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer, then, how this screw got loose,&#8221; said Blake
as he tightened it with the blade of his pocket knife.
&#8220;It sets tight enough. Of course it might have come
from the factory a bit loose, and jarred out with the
firing; but neither seems probable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it all right now?&#8221; queried Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&ndash;&ndash;Seems to me someone <i>must</i> have loosened
this screw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference how it happened, if it will
not happen again?&#8221; irritably replied Ashton. &#8220;Guess
this bacon is fried enough. Let&#8217;s eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake recoupled the rifle, emptied the magazine,
tested the mechanism, refilled the magazine, and joined
his ravenous companion in his ill-cooked meal.</p>
<p>Immediately after eating, Ashton flung himself
down in the tent. A few minutes later Blake crept in
beside him and struck a match. The young man had
already fallen into the deep slumber of utter physical
and mental relaxation. Blake went outside and listened
to the wailing of the coyotes. Difficult as it was to
determine the direction of their mournful cries, he at
last satisfied himself that they were circling entirely
around the camp.</p>
<p>A watchdog could not have indicated with greater
certainty that there was no other wild beast or any
human being lurking near the waterhole. Blake crept
back into the tent and was soon fast asleep beside his
companion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE BRINK</h3>
</div>
<p>Early to bed, early to rise. The two men were
up at dawn. During the night the coyotes had
sneaked into the camp. But Blake had fastened the
food in the chuck-box and slung everything gnawable
up in the branches out of reach of the sly thieves.</p>
<p>At sunrise the two started out on their day&#8217;s work,
Ashton carrying his rifle and canteen and the level rod,
Blake with the level and a bag containing their lunch
and a two-quart sirup-can of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run a new line from the dike bench, around
the hill and across the valley the way we rode out
yesterday,&#8221; said the engineer, as they climbed the slope
above the waterhole. &#8220;That will give us a check by
cross-tying to the line of the creek levels where it runs
into the gulch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you trust to the accuracy of your own
work?&#8221; asked Ashton with evident intent to mortify.</p>
<p>Blake smiled in his good-natured way. &#8220;You forget
the first rule of engineering. Always check when
you can, then re-check and check again.&ndash;&ndash;Now, if
you&#8217;ll kindly give me a reading off that bench.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Ashton complied, though with evident ill will. He
had wakened in good spirits, but was fast returning
to his sullenness of the previous day. He took his
time in going from the bench-mark to the first turning
point. Blake moved up past him with inspiring briskness,
but the younger man kept to his leisurely saunter.
In rounding the corner of the hill twice as much time
was consumed as was necessary.</p>
<p>When they came to the last turn at the foot of the
rocky slope, where the line struck out across the valley
towards the foot of the mountain side, Ashton paused
to roll a cigarette before holding his rod for the reading.
Small as was the incident, it was particularly aggravating
to an engineer. The reading would have
taken only a moment, and he could then have rolled
his cigarette and smoked it while Blake was moving
past him for the next &#8220;set up.&#8221; Instead, he deliberately
kept Blake waiting until the cigarette had been
rolled and lighted.</p>
<p>Blake &#8220;pulled up&#8221; his level and started forward,
his face impassive. Ashton leaned jauntily on the rod,
sucked in a mouthful of smoke, and raising his cigarette,
flicked the ash from the tip with his little finger.
At the same instant a bullet from the crags above
him pierced the crown of his hat. He pitched forward
on his face, rolled half over, and lay quiet.</p>
<p>Most men would have been dumfounded by the
frightful suddenness of the occurrence&ndash;&ndash;the shot and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
the instant fall of Ashton. It was like a stroke of
lightning out of a clear sky. Blake did not stand
gaping even for a moment. As Ashton&#8217;s senseless body
struck the ground, he sprang sideways and bent to lay
down his instrument, with the instinctive carefulness of
an old railroad surveyor. A swift rush towards Ashton
barely saved him from the second bullet that came
pinging down from the hill crest. It burned across
the back of his shoulder.</p>
<p>Heedless of the blood spurting from the wound in
the side of Ashton&#8217;s head, Blake snatched up the automatic
rifle and fired at a point between two knobs of
rock on the hill crest. Promptly a hat appeared, then
an arm and a rifle. It might have been expected that
a bullet would have instantly followed; yet the assassin
was strangely deliberate about getting his aim. Blake
did not wait for him. He began to fire as fast as the
automatic ejector and reloader set the rifle trigger.
Three bullets sped up at the assassin before he had
time to drop back out of sight.</p>
<p>Blake started up the hillside, his pale eyes like white-hot
steel. He was in a fury, but it was the cold fury
of a man too courageous for reckless bravado. He
went up the hill as an Apache would have charged,
dodging from cover to cover and, wherever possible,
keeping in line with a rock or tree in his successive
rushes. At every brief stop he scanned the ridge crest
for a sign of his enemy. But the assassin did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
show himself. For all that Blake could tell, he might
be waiting for a sure shot, or he might be lying with
a bullet through his brain.</p>
<p>To avoid suicidal exposure, the engineer was compelled
to veer off to the right in his ascent. He
reached the ridge crest without a shot having been
fired at him. Leaping suddenly to his feet, he scrambled
up to the flat top of a high crag, from which he
could peer down upon the others. The natural embrazure
from which the assassin had fired was exposed
to his view; but the place was empty. He looked cautiously
about at the many huge bowlders behind which
a hundred men might have been crouching unseen by
him, advantageous as was his position. To flush the
assassin would require a bold rush over and around
the rocks.</p>
<p>Blake set his powerful jaw and gathered himself together
for the leap down from his crag. At that moment
his alert eye caught a glimpse of a swiftly
moving object on the mesa at the foot of the far side
of the hill. It was a horse and rider racing out of
sight around the bend of a ridge point.</p>
<p>Blake whipped the rifle to his shoulder. But the
cowardly fugitive had disappeared. He lowered the
rifle and started back down the hill faster than he had
come up. Leaping like a goat, sliding, rushing&ndash;&ndash;he
raced to the bottom in a direct line for Ashton.</p>
<p>The victim lay as he had fallen, his head ghastly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
red with blood, which was still oozing from his wound.
Blake dropped down beside the flaccid body and tore
open the front of the silk shirt. He thrust in his hand.
For some moments he was baffled by the violent throbbing
of his own pulse. Then, at last, he detected a
heartbeat, very feeble and slow yet unmistakable.</p>
<p>He turned Ashton on his side, and washing away
the blood with water from the canteen, examined the
wound with utmost carefulness. The bullet had
pierced the scalp and plowed a furrow down along the
side of the skull, grazing but not penetrating the bone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only stunned.... Mighty close, though,&#8221; muttered
Blake. He looked at the ashen face of the
wounded man and added apprehensively, &#8220;Too close!...
Concussion&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastily he knotted a compress bandage made of
handkerchiefs and neckerchiefs around the bleeding
head, and stretching Ashton flat on his back, began to
pump his arms up and down as is done in resuscitating a
drowned person. After a time Ashton&#8217;s face began to
lose its deathly pallor. His heart beat less feebly;
he drew in a deep sighing breath, and stared up dazedly
at Blake, with slowly returning consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll smoke all I please and when I please,&#8221; he murmured
in a supercilious drawl.</p>
<p>Blake dashed his face with the cupful of water still
left in the canteen. The wounded man flushed with
quick anger and attempted to rise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what you&ndash;&ndash;How dare you?&#8221; he
spluttered, only to sink back with a groan, &#8220;My head!
O-o-oh! You&#8217;ve smashed my head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck that your head <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> smashed,&#8221;
replied Blake. &#8220;It was a bullet knocked you over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bullet?&#8221; echoed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Scoundrel up on the hill tried to get us
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up on the hill?&#8221; Ashton twisted his head about,
in alarm, to look at the hill crest. &#8220;But if he&ndash;&ndash;He
may shoot again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this time. I went up for him. He went
down faster, other side the hill. Saw him on the run.
The sneaking&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Blake closed his lips on the word.
After a moment his grimness relaxed. &#8220;Came back to
start your funeral. Found you&#8217;d cheated the undertaker.
How do you feel now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Ashton, again trying to raise
himself, only to sink back as before. &#8220;My head!&ndash;&ndash;What
makes me so weak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; reassured Blake. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a
scalp wound. You are weak from the shock and a
little loss of blood. I&#8217;ll get you a drink from my
can, and then tote you into camp. You&#8217;ll be all right
in a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fetched the can of water from his bag, which he
had dropped beside the level. Ashton drank with the
thirstiness of one who has lost blood. When at last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
his thirst was quenched, he glanced up at Blake with
a look of half reluctant apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said something about your striking me,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;I did not understand&ndash;&ndash;did not realize I
had been shot. You see, just before&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; broke in Blake. &#8220;I owe you
a bigger apology. Last evening, while you were out
hunting, someone took a shot at me. It must have
been this same sneaking skunk. I thought it was
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought I could try to&ndash;&ndash;to shoot you?&#8221;
muttered Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s the old matter of the bridge, and
you seem to think I am responsible for what your
father has done. But after you came in, I soon concluded
that you had fired towards the camp unintentionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had asked,&#8221; explained Ashton, &#8220;I was
around at the far end of these hills, nearly two miles
from the camp, when I shot at the wolf and the rifle
went wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a fortunate occurrence&ndash;&ndash;your going out
and seeing the wolf;&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t
taken that shot, we would not have known your rifle
was out of gear. My first bullet merely made the
sneak rise up to pot me. If the rapidity of the next
three shots hadn&#8217;t rattled him, I believe he would have
potted me, instead of running.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So that was it?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton. &#8220;Do you
know, I believe it must be the same scoundrel who attacked
me the first day I rode down Dry Fork. No
doubt he remembered how I ripped loose at him with
the automatic-catch set.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your thieving guide?&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;But why
should he try to kill me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; murmured Ashton.
&#8220;Another drink, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tote you back to camp, and&ndash;&ndash;No, I&#8217;ll
lay you over there in the shade and go up to see if he
is in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Picking up the wounded man as easily as if he had
been a child, the engineer carried him over under a
tree, fetched him the can of water, and for the second
time climbed the rocky hillside. Scaling his lookout
crag, he surveyed the country below him. A mile
down the creek two riders were coming up towards the
waterhole at an easy canter. He surmised that they
were his wife and Miss Knowles.</p>
<p>Their approach brought a shade of anxiety into his
strong face. He swept the landscape with his glance.
A little cloud of dust far out on the mesa towards
Split Peak caught his eye. He looked at it steadfastly
under his hand, and drew a deep breath of relief as he
made out a fleeing horse and rider.</p>
<p>He descended to Ashton, and taking him up pick-a-back,
swung away for the camp with long, swift
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
strides. Before he had gone half the distance, he felt
Ashton&#8217;s arms loosening their clasp of his neck. He
caught him as he sank in a swoon. Without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, he slung his senseless burden up on
his shoulder like a sack of meal, and hastened on faster
than before.</p>
<p>Swiftly as he walked, the ladies reached the camp
before him. When he came to the top of the dike
slope, his wife had dismounted and Isobel was handing
down the baby to her. As the girl slipped out of
the saddle she looked up the slope. With a startled
cry, she darted to meet Blake.</p>
<p>Quick to forestall her alarm, he called in a gasping
shout: &#8220;Not serious&ndash;&ndash;not serious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Blake!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What
has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scalp wound&ndash;&ndash;faint&ndash;&ndash;blood loss,&#8221; Blake panted
in terse answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is wounded? O-o-oh!&#8221; She ran up and
looked fearfully at the bloodsoaked bandages across
Ashton&#8217;s hanging head.</p>
<p>Blake staggered on down the slope without pausing.
Genevieve had started to meet him. But at her husband&#8217;s
panting explanation, she laid the baby on the
nearest soft spot of earth and darted to the kit-chest.
She was opening a &#8220;first aid&#8221; box when Blake crashed
through the bushes and sank down with his burden under
the first tree.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>Genevieve hastened towards the men, calling to her
companion: &#8220;Water, Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;that pail by the
fireplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flew to fetch a bucket of water from the
pool.</p>
<p>Blake was peering anxiously down into Ashton&#8217;s
white face. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;know&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he
panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; reassured his wife. &#8220;He will soon be all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew the unconscious man flat on his back and
held a bottle of ammonia to his nostrils. The powerful
stimulant revived him just as the girl came running
back with the water. He opened his eyes, and the
first object they rested upon was her anxious pitiful
face. He smiled and whispered gallantly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be afraid. I&#8217;m all right&ndash;&ndash;now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll drink first,&#8221; said Blake.</p>
<p>He took a deep draught from the pail, doused a
hatful of water over his hot head and face, and
stretched out to cool off. Genevieve, assisted by the
deeply concerned girl, took the handkerchief bandage
from Ashton&#8217;s head and washed the wound with an
antiseptic solution. She then clipped away the hair
from the edges and drew the scalp together with a
number of stitches.</p>
<p>In this last the hardy cowgirl was unable to help.
She clasped Ashton&#8217;s hand convulsively and sat shuddering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Ashton smiled up into her tender pitying eyes.
Genevieve had numbed his wound with cocaine. He
was quite satisfied with the situation.</p>
<p>Another antiseptic washing and a compress of sterilized
cotton bound on with surgical bandages completed
the operation. Then, when it was all over
with, the young mother, who had gone through everything
with the aplomb and deftness of a surgeon,
quietly sank back in a faint. On the instant Blake
was reaching for the ammonia bottle.</p>
<p>A whiff restored his wife to consciousness. She
opened her eyes, and smiling at her weakness, sought
to rise. He held her down with gentle force and ordered
her to lie quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall fetch Tommy,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all
take a <i>siesta</i> until noon.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE PLOTTERS</h3>
</div>
<p>When Blake came back with the baby, Isobel
begged him for a full account of how Ashton
had been wounded. In relating the affair he sought
to minimize the danger that he had incurred, and he
omitted all mention of the bullet shot at him the
previous evening. But his account was frequently interrupted
by exclamations from his wife and Isobel.</p>
<p>At the end he dwelt strongly on the cowardly haste
of the assassin&#8217;s flight; only to be met by a shrewdly
anxious rejoinder from the girl: &#8220;He ran away after
he attacked Lafe the other time. He will come back
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom!&#8221; cried Genevieve&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;if he does!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will get him, that is all there is to it,&#8221; replied
her husband. &#8220;What do you say to that, Ashton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not have the chance,&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe he has nerve enough to try it the third
time. But if he should&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I hope he keeps running forever!&#8221;
fervently wished Isobel. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
close a miss that was, Lafe?&ndash;&ndash;and the other time,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like having one Miss close,&#8221; he punned.</p>
<p>The girl blushed, but failed to show any sign of
resentment.</p>
<p>Blake looked significantly at his wife. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
know but what I&#8217;ve changed my mind about a <i>siesta</i>,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Tommy gone to sleep just
when I wanted to fight him. Do you think Miss
Chuckie can keep him and Ashton from running away
if I go to bring in the level?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you had started to run the line of levels
across to the mountain?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.... This little pleasantry has knocked us
out of a day&#8217;s work and you out of your trip to the
ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why couldn&#8217;t I rod for you?&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;I noticed Lafayette the other day. It seems easier
than golfing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall do it. A good walk is exactly what
I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Genevieve!&#8221; hastily appealed Isobel. &#8220;Surely
you&#8217;ll not go off and leave me&ndash;&ndash;us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas is asleep, and Lafayette needs to be
quiet,&#8221; was the demure reply. &#8220;Come, Tom. We&#8217;ll
run the levels over to the foot of the mountain, at
least.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>With a reproachful glance at the smiling couple, the
girl slipped over to put Thomas Herbert between herself
and Ashton. Blake found another bag and can,
which last he filled with water from the bucket.
Genevieve put on the cowboy hat that she had borrowed
at the ranch, and sprang up to join him.</p>
<p>He paused for a question: &#8220;How about leaving
the rifle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isobel put her hand to a fold in her skirt and drew
out her long-barreled automatic pistol. &#8220;I can do
as well or better with this,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wicked looking thing!&#8221; exclaimed Genevieve.
&#8220;Surely, dear, you do not shoot it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot it!&#8221; put in Ashton. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t she told you
about saving me from a rattler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, and he told about the rattlesnake
in the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I ought to have shot quicker,&#8221; Isobel explained,
when he finished. &#8220;I missed the head,
though I aimed at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we&#8217;ve left Thomas about on the
ground!&#8221; exclaimed Genevieve. &#8220;Are there any of
the horrid things around here? Is that why you
carry the pistol?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t be afraid. We&#8217;ve killed them out
here, long ago, because of the cattle. I carry my pistol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
on the chance of killing wolves. They&#8217;re dreadfully
harmful to the calves and colts, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; praised Blake, as he picked up
the rifle. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re off.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started away, hand in hand with his wife. They
were soon at the top of the dike slope and almost dancing
along over the dry turf. It was months since
they had been alone together in the open, and they
were still deeper in love than at the time of their marriage&ndash;&ndash;if
that were possible.</p>
<p>They soon reached the place where the shooting had
occurred. Here they picked up the lunch bag, Ashton&#8217;s
canteen and his hat, now punctured with another
bullet hole; and at once started to carry the line of
levels out across the valley. A few words of instruction
made an efficient rodwoman of Genevieve, so that
they soon reached the foot of the ridge up which her
husband had led Ashton the previous day. Here he
established a bench-mark, and turned along the base
of the escarpment to the mouth of Dry Fork Gully,
where he checked the line of levels that had been run
up the bed of the creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work&ndash;&ndash;less than three tenths difference,
and all that I am concerned about is an error in feet,&#8221;
he commented. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting along towards noon.
We&#8217;ll go up the gulch, and eat our lunch in the shade.
This place is almost as much of a sight as the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Genevieve more than agreed with her husband&#8217;s
opinion when he led her up into the stupendous gorge
and the walls of rock began to tower on each side ever
steeper and loftier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do not see how anything can be so grand,
so awesome as this!&#8221; she cried, gazing up the precipices.
&#8220;It makes me positively giddy to look at such
heights!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stop off for a while,&#8221; advised Blake. &#8220;We
are almost to where the bottom tilts skyward. You
can stargaze while we are eating lunch. It&#8217;s rougher
along here. We can get on faster this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked her up in his arms as though she were a
feather, and carried her on up the gulch to the foot
of the Titanic chute. Here, resting on a flat rock
in the cool semi-twilight of the gorge bottom, they
ate their lunch and talked with as much zest as if they
were still new acquaintances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those awful cliffs!&#8221; she murmured, lowering her
gaze from the colossal walls above her. &#8220;I cannot
bear to look at them any longer. They overpower
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you look down into the ca&ntilde;on,&#8221; replied
her husband. &#8220;In some ways it is more tremendous
than the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado&ndash;&ndash;the width
is so much narrower in proportion to the depth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes these frightful chasms?&ndash;&ndash;earthquakes?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Water,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water? Not all these hundreds and thousands
of feet cut down through the solid rock!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every foot,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;Think of water flowing
along in the same bed and always washing sand
and gravel and even bowlders downstream&ndash;&ndash;grind,
grind, grind, through the centuries and hundreds of
centuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no water here, Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, and no chance of any this time of year,
else I wouldn&#8217;t have brought you in here. A sudden
heavy June rain up above there would pour down a
torrent that would drown us before we could run three
hundred yards. Imagine a flood roaring down that
bumpy shoot-the-chutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! It&#8217;s too terrifying. Is that the way it
will be if you get the water and dig the tunnel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. At this end, the tunnel may terminate any
place from down here to a thousand feet up, but in
any event far below the top. I hope it proves to be
well up. The greater the drop to the level of the
mesa, the more turbines could be put in to generate
electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds so inspiring! But, Dear&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Genevieve
looked at her husband with a shade of anxiety&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;even
if this project is feasible, do you feel you should
carry it through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean on account of Miss Chuckie and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
father,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have considered their side
of the matter, and even at the first I saw how&ndash;&ndash;Listen,
Sweetheart. No one knows better than you
that I&#8217;m an engineer to the very marrow of my bones.
My work in life is to construct,&ndash;&ndash;to harness the forces
of nature and compel them to serve mankind; and to
save waste&ndash;&ndash;waste material, waste energy&ndash;&ndash;and put
it to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know, Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;in the bottom of Deep
Ca&ntilde;on is a river&ndash;&ndash;waste waters down there beyond the
reach of this rich but waterless land, down in the
gloom, doing no good to anything or anybody, frittering
away their energy on barren rocks. Why, it&#8217;s as
bad as the way Ashton, with all the good qualities we
now see he has in him&ndash;&ndash;the way he dissipated his
strength and his brains and his father&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Dear! wasn&#8217;t it a splendid thing when he was
thrown out of his rut of wastefulness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise known as the primrose path, or the
great white way,&#8221; added Blake. &#8220;It certainly was a
throw out. I&#8217;m as pleased as I am astonished that
he seems to have landed squarely on his feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a marvelous change it has made in him!&#8221;
exclaimed Genevieve. &#8220;Sometimes I hardly can believe
it really is Lafayette. He is so serious and
manly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing he has changed,&#8221; replied Blake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
&#8220;If Miss Chuckie hadn&#8217;t told us he had made a clean
breast of that bridge, I should begin to feel worried
about&ndash;&ndash;Do you know, Sweetheart, it&#8217;s the strangest
thing in the world the way I feel towards that girl.
It&#8217;s not because she is so lovely. Of course I enjoy
her beauty, but that&#8217;s not it. If Tommy were a girl
and grown up&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s how I feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a very dear, sweet girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So are several of your friends&ndash;&ndash;our friends,&#8221;
said Blake. &#8220;This is different. The very first day
we met her, there was something about her voice and
face&ndash;&ndash;seemed as though I already knew her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knew you, through what she had read of you.
She warned me, in that frank, charming way of hers,
that you were a hero to her and I must not mind if she
worshiped you openly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake laughed pleasedly. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the greatest!
And the way she chums with me! Wonder if that
is what makes Ashton so sore at me? The idiot!
Can&#8217;t he see the difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovers always are blind,&#8221; said Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; he rejoined, his eyes, as he gazed
down into hers, as blue and tender as Isobel&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The young wife blushed deliciously and rewarded
him with a kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about Chuckie?&#8221; she returned to the previous
question. &#8220;You were going to tell me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to tell you something you will think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
is very fanciful&ndash;&ndash;and it is! Do you know why I am
so taken with that girl? It&#8217;s because she reminds me
of my sisters&ndash;&ndash;what they might have grown to be!...
God!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he bent over with his face in his shaking
hands&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;God! If only they had gone any other
way than&ndash;&ndash;the way they did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor dear boy!&#8221; soothed his wife, her hand
on his downbent head. &#8220;Let us trust that they are in
a happier world, a world where sorrow and pain&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only I could believe that!&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>Genevieve waited a few moments and with quiet
tactfulness sought to divert him from his grief: &#8220;If
Chuckie reminds you of them, Dear&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might be either&ndash;&ndash;only Mary, the older one,
had dark brown eyes. But Belle&#8217;s were blue like
Chuckie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pure blue her eyes are&ndash;&ndash;the sweet true
girl! Why can&#8217;t you regard her as your sister, and&ndash;&ndash;and
give over further thought of this irrigation
project?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake looked up, completely diverted. &#8220;You little
schemer! So that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been working
around to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you. It is because I am so fond of
Chuckie that I am determined to get water on Dry
Mesa, if it is possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To make use of those waste waters,&#8221; he explained;
&#8220;to turn this dusty semi-desert into a garden;
and to benefit Chuckie by doubling the value of her
father&#8217;s property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could that be, when the farmers would divide
up his range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He owns five sections, Chuckie told me. What
are they worth now? But with water on them, even
without a single tree planted, they would sell as
orchard land for more than all his herd; and he would
still have his cattle. He could sell them to the settlers
for more than what he now gets shipping them
over the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to see, Tom. I might have known it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, of course. We&#8217;re to keep it
from them as a happy surprise, because it may not
come off. There&#8217;s still the question whether the
water in the ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if it is! How delightful it will be to help
Mr. Knowles and Chuckie, besides, as you say, turning
this desert into a garden!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That valley is a natural reservoir site to hold
flood waters,&#8221; continued the engineer. &#8220;All that&#8217;s
needed is a dam built across the narrow place above
the waterhole, with the dike for foundation. I would
build it of rock from the tunnel, run down on a gravity
tram.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve worked it all out?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not all, only the general scheme. If the tunnel
comes through high enough up here, we shall be able
to manufacture cheap electricity to sell. Just think
of our settlers plowing by electricity, and their wives
cooking on electric stoves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You humorous boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I mean it. There&#8217;s another thing&ndash;&ndash;I
wouldn&#8217;t whisper it even to you if you weren&#8217;t my
partner as well as my wife. I have reason to believe
the creek bed above the dike is a rich placer. I&#8217;ve
planned to take Knowles and Ashton in on that discovery&ndash;&ndash;Gowan,
too, if Knowles asks it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A placer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, placer mine&ndash;&ndash;gold washed down in the
creek bed. But it&#8217;s a small thing compared with another
discovery I&#8217;ve made. Up there&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Blake
pointed up the steep ledges that he had climbed&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
found a bonanza.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bonanza? What is that, pray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mint, a John D. bank account, a&ndash;&ndash;Guess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gold mine! Oh, Tom, how romantic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s free-milling quartz. We can mill it ourselves,
and not have to pay tribute to the Smelting
Trust. That&#8217;s romance&ndash;&ndash;or at least sounds like it.
You will pay for all the development work, in return
for one-third share. I shall take a third, as the discoverer,
and Chuckie gets the remaining third as
grub-staker.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is staking us with grub&ndash;&ndash;food and supplies.
If she had not sent for me to come and look over the
situation, I should not have been here to stumble on
this mine. So she gets a share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, glad, Tom! Isn&#8217;t it nice to be able to
do fine things for others? I&#8217;m so glad for Chuckie&#8217;s
sake, because, if Lafayette keeps on as he is doing
now, he may win his father&#8217;s forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that to do with Chuckie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I know what she is, Dear; yet if she had
no money, his father might insist on regarding her as
a mere farm girl. He is as&ndash;&ndash;as snobbish as I was
when we were flung ashore by the storm, there in
Mozambique.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see that it matters any to Chuckie what
Ashton senior thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t see. You&#8217;re as blind as
when I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; the lady blushed&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;as when I had to fling
myself at you to make you see. The dear girl is as
deeply in love with Lafayette as he is with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No? She doesn&#8217;t show it. How can you tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that Mr. Gowan is desperately in love
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That stands to reason. He couldn&#8217;t help but be.
Can&#8217;t say I like the fellow. He may be all right,
though. Must have some good qualities&ndash;&ndash;Chuckie
seems to be very fond of him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As fond as if he were a brother. No; Lafayette
is to be the happy man&ndash;&ndash;unless he backslides. We
must help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s another thing that hangs
on this project. If it proves to be feasible, I can give
Ashton a chance to make good as an engineer. I used
to think he must have bought his C.E. Now I see
he has the makings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can be brilliant when he chooses. If only he
were not so&ndash;&ndash;so scatter-brained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What he needed was a jolt heavy enough to shake
him together. It seems as though his father gave it
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That shock, and being picked up by Chuckie,&#8221;
agreed Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help her keep him braced until the cement
sets,&#8221; said her husband. &#8220;It&#8217;s even worse to let
brains go to waste than water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far worse! What is the good of all your engineering&ndash;&ndash;of
all the machinery, yes, and all the culture
of civilization, if not to uplift men and women? May
the next generation work for the uplifting of all mankind,
both materially and spiritually!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might make a try at it ourselves,&#8221; said Blake.
&#8220;As for the future, I know it will not be your fault if
our member of the next generation fails to do his share
of uplift work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>The young mother placed her hand on her bosom,
and sprang up. &#8220;We should be going back, Dear.
Thomas will be wakening.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>INDIAN SHOES</h3>
</div>
<p>They returned along the shadowy bottom of the
great gorge to the glaring sunshine of the open
creek bed, where they had left the rod and level.
Blake placed both upon one of his broad shoulders,
and gave his wife the unencumbered arm to assist her
somewhat hurried pace.</p>
<p>As they approached the dike her hasty steps quickened
to a run. She darted ahead down to the camp.
Thomas Herbert Vincent was vociferating for his
dinner. Blake followed at a walk. He was only a
father.</p>
<p>When he came down to the trees he found Isobel
and Ashton alone. The girl&#8217;s manner was constrained
and her color higher than usual. Ashton, comfortably
outstretched on a blanket with her saddle for pillow,
frowned petulantly at the intruder. But Isobel
sprang up and came to meet Blake, unable to conceal
her relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so glad to see Genevieve,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
came back just in time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Blake, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>She blushed, but quickly recovered from her confusion
to dimple and cast a teasing glance at Ashton.
&#8220;Baby woke up,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You may not
know it, but babies cry when they fail to get what they
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting what he wants&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not!&#8221; complained
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I must see if Genevieve needs anything,&#8221;
murmured the girl, and she fled to the tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need you!&#8221; Ashton called after her without
avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you feeling?&#8221; inquired Blake.</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s frown deepened to a scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t mean how you feel towards me,&#8221; added
Blake. &#8220;I can guess that. My reference was to your
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; snapped Ashton. &#8220;Needn&#8217;t
worry. I&#8217;m still weak and dizzy, but I shall be quite
able to do my work tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said the engineer, with insistent
good humor. &#8220;However, if you feel at all shaky in
the morning, I can perhaps get Gowan, or maybe Miss
Chuckie would like to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; broke in Ashton. &#8220;She shall not! I will
do it, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Blake. He put down the level
and rod, but retained the rifle. &#8220;Tell the ladies I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
be back before long. I am going to look for something
I forgot this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for the other&#8217;s reply, he returned
up the dike slope and around the bend of the hill to
where Ashton had been shot. That for which he was
looking was not here, for he at once turned and started
up the hill. He climbed direct to the place where the
assassin had lain in wait.</p>
<p>The bare ledge told Blake nothing, but from a
crevice nearby he picked out two long thirty-eight
caliber rifle shells. He put them into his pocket and
went over to scan the mesa from the top of his lookout
crag. He could see no sign of the fugitive murderer.
Down below the mesa side of the hill, however, he saw
a man riding up the bank of Dry Fork, and recognized
him as Knowles.</p>
<p>Trained to alert observation by years of life on the
range, the cowman had already perceived Blake. He
wheeled aside and rode towards the hill when the engineer
waved his hat and began to descend. The two
met at the foot of the rugged slope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Mr. Blake,&#8221; greeted the cowman, &#8220;I
thought I&#8217;d just ride up to see how things are coming
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast as they might, Mr. Knowles. We
have stopped for repairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t broken your level?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Ashton is laid up for the day with a scalp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
wound. We were shot at this morning from up there&ndash;&ndash;other
side of the crest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot at, and Lafe hit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seriously, though it could not well have been
a closer shave. He says he will be all right by tomorrow,&#8221;
said Blake, and he gave the bald details of the
occurrence in a few words.</p>
<p>Knowles listened without comment, his leathery
face stolid, but his eyes glinting. When Blake had
finished, he remarked shortly: &#8220;Must be the same
man. Let&#8217;s see those shells.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake handed over the two empty cartridge shells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-eight,&#8221; confirmed Knowles. &#8220;Same as
were fired at Lafe before. Kid and Chuckie showed
me how a thirty-eight fitted the hole in Lafe&#8217;s silver
flask. About where did the snake crawl down the
hill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not far from here. He could not have gone any
considerable distance along the top or side. He was
down and riding away when I reached the crags, and
I had not lost much time coming up the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take an Indian to make out his tracks on this
dry ground,&#8221; remarked the cowman. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try a
look, though, at his hawss&#8217;s hoof prints. Just keep
behind, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw the reins over the head of his horse, and
dismounted, to walk slowly along the more level
ground at the foot of the slope. Blake followed, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
he had requested, but scrutinizing the ground with a
gaze no less keenly observant than that of his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty queer,&#8221; said Knowles, after they had carried
their examination over a hundred yards. &#8220;Either
he came down more slanting or else&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of this?&#8221; Blake interrupted,
bending over a blurred round print in the dust between
two grass tufts.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sho!</i>&#8221; exclaimed the cowman as he peered at the
mark. &#8220;That&#8217;s why, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian shoes,&#8221; said Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen a thing or two. You&#8217;re no tenderfoot,&#8221;
remarked Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have myself shrunk rawhide shoes on horses&#8217;
hoofs when short of iron shoes,&#8221; Blake explained.
&#8220;This would make a hard trail to run down without
hounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowman straightened and looked at his companion,
his weather-beaten face set in quiet resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s better than hounds,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This is one badman who has played his game once
too often. I&#8217;m going to run him down if it takes all
year and all the men in the county. There&#8217;s a couple
of Ute bucks being held in the jail at Stockchute, to be
tried for hunting deer. I&#8217;m going to get the loan of
them. The sheriff will turn out with a posse, and we&#8217;ll
trail that snake, if it takes us clear over into Utah.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a fair chance to get him with Ute
trackers,&#8221; agreed Blake.</p>
<p>Knowles shook his head. &#8220;Unless you&#8217;re particular
to come along, Mr. Blake, I&#8217;d like you and Lafe
to keep on with this survey. I&#8217;ve been worrying over
the chance of losing my range, till it&#8217;s got on my
nerves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Knowles. I shall go ahead in the
morning, if Ashton is able to rod. It will be best, I
suppose, for my wife and Miss Chuckie to remain close
at the ranch until you make sure where this trail leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s a snake, but the Indian shoes prove he&#8217;s
Western&ndash;&ndash;He won&#8217;t strike at the ladies. Another
thing, I&#8217;m going to give you Kid for guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may prefer to join the posse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he&#8217;ll prefer that. You can count on
Kid Gowan when it comes to a man hunt. He&#8217;ll stay,
though, all right. I don&#8217;t want Mrs. Blake to think
she has to stop indoors. With Kid on the lookout
around your camp, the ladies can feel free to come and
go any time between sunup and sundown, and you and
Lafe can do what you want. There won&#8217;t be any more
shooting, unless it&#8217;s by Kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I&#8217;m not anxious to
play hide and seek with a man who shoots and runs.
When can we expect the rope and spikes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; replied Knowles. &#8220;Kid
can be packing them and your camp outfit up to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
ca&ntilde;on while you and Lafe are running your line of
levels. He ought to be home by now. He was gone
when the men turned out this morning. Soon as I get
back I&#8217;ll send him up to camp with you. He can bring
along Rocket, to be ready for a chase, providing we
can find the brute. Queer about that hawss.
Wanted to ride him this morning. Found he&#8217;d got
out and gone off the way he used to before Lafe
gentled him.&#8221;</p>
<p>While talking, the two men had returned to the cowman&#8217;s
horse and started around the hill to the camp.
They found Isobel and Genevieve and the baby all
engaged in entertaining Ashton. Knowles briefly congratulated
the wounded man, and led his pony down to
the pool for a drink. Blake had seated himself beside
his wife. She handed the baby to him, and remarking
that she also wished to drink, she followed Knowles.</p>
<p>The cowman smiled at her reassuringly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not afraid of any more shooting, ma&#8217;am, are you?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told your husband that Kid is to come
up to keep guard. He will stay right along, unless
that scoundrel is trailed down sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall have no fear, Mr. Knowles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t, and you and Chuckie can come and
go just the same as ever. I don&#8217;t want your visit
spoiled. It&#8217;s a great treat to all of us to have you
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to my husband and myself to be your guests!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
I have quite fallen in love with your daughter, Mr.
Knowles. If you&#8217;ll permit me to say it, you are very
fortunate to have so lovely and lovable a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So beautiful&ndash;&ndash;and her character as beautiful as
her face. How you must prize her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prize her!&#8221; repeated Knowles, his usual stolid
face aglow with pride and tenderness. &#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am,
I couldn&#8217;t hold her more in liking if she was my own
flesh and blood!&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve suddenly bent down to hide the intense
emotion that had struck the color from her face. Yet
after a moment&#8217;s pause, she spoke in a composed, almost
casual tone: &#8220;Then Chuckie is not your own
daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the way you mean. Hasn&#8217;t she told you?
I adopted her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; remarked Genevieve, with a show of polite
interest. &#8220;But of course, taking her when a young
infant, she has always thought of you as her own
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;what I can&#8217;t get over is that she feels that
way, and I feel the same to her, though I never saw or
heard of her till she was going on fourteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Genevieve could no longer suppress her
agitation. &#8220;Then she is&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m sure that she must
be&ndash;&ndash;You said she came from the East, from
Chicago?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am! I didn&#8217;t say where she came from,&#8221;
curtly replied the cowman.</p>
<p>The shock of his brusqueness restored the lady to
her usual quiet composure. Looking up into his face,
she found it as blank and impenetrable as a cement
wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must pardon me,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I myself
am a Chicago girl, so you must see how natural
it is for me to hope that so sweet and beautiful a girl
as Chuckie came from my city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chuckie is my daughter,&#8221; stated Knowles in a flat
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will kindly permit me to explain. My husband&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chuckie is my daughter, legally adopted,&#8221; repeated
the cowman. &#8220;You can see what she is like. If that
is not enough, ma&#8217;am, I can&#8217;t prevent you from declining
our hospitality, though we&#8217;d be mighty sorry to
have you and your husband leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears started into Genevieve&#8217;s hazel eyes.
&#8220;Mr. Knowles! how could you think for a moment
that I&ndash;&ndash;that we&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he hastened to apologize.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt your feelings. You see, I&#8217;m
kind of prejudiced along some lines. I&#8217;ve been bred
up to the Western idea that it isn&#8217;t just etiquette to
ask about people&#8217;s antecedents. Real Western, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
mean. Our city folks are nearly as bad as you Easterners
over family trees. As if a child isn&#8217;t as much
descended from its mother&#8217;s maternal grandmother as
from its father&#8217;s paternal grandfather!&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve smiled at this adroit diversion of the subject
by the seemingly simple Westerner, and replied:
&#8220;My father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s parents were farm people.
My husband worked his way up out of the Chicago
slums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did?&#8221; The cowman could not conceal his astonishment.
He looked curiously into the lady&#8217;s high-bred
face. &#8220;Well, now, that sure is something to be
right proud of&ndash;&ndash;not that I&#8217;d have exactly expected
you to think so. If you&#8217;ll excuse me, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m
more surprised at the way you feel about it than that
he was able to do such a big thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is responsible for what he is born. But
we are at least partly entitled to the credit or discredit
of what we become,&#8221; she observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good American doctrine, ma&#8217;am&ndash;&ndash;Western
American!&#8221; approved Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should apply to women as well as men,&#8221; she
stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought,&#8221; he dryly replied, and he jerked up the
head of his pawing horse. &#8220;Here, you! I guess
it&#8217;s high time we were starting in, ma&#8217;am. Kid may
think he&#8217;s to lay over at the ranch until morning. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
want to get him out here before dusk. I don&#8217;t reckon
there&#8217;s any show of that snake coming back tonight,
but it&#8217;s as well to be on the safe side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked up the slope towards the others, unbuckling
his cartridge belt as he went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sling on your saddle, honey,&#8221; he called to his
daughter.</p>
<p>The girl sprang up from beside Ashton and ran to
fetch her own and Genevieve&#8217;s picketed ponies. Her
father held out his belt and revolver to the engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my Colt&#8217;s, Mr. Blake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have
another at home. You won&#8217;t need it, but I may as
well leave it. We&#8217;re going to lope in now, so as to
hustle Kid out to you before night. Just swap me that
yearling for my gun. It wouldn&#8217;t seem natural not
to be toting something that can make a noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas never cries unless he needs attention,&#8221;
Genevieve sought to defend her infant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. It&#8217;s a good thing he knows that
much already. You have to make yourself heard to
get what you want in the world generally, as well as in
hostleries and eating-houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake buckled on the cartridge belt, with its holstered
revolver, and went to help saddle the ponies.
Ashton watched him and Isobel narrowly. He was
far from pleased with the familiarity of their talk and
manner towards one another. Twice the girl put her
hand on Blake&#8217;s arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>In marked contrast to this affectionate intimacy,
Isobel was distrait and hurried when she came to take
leave of the wounded man. He had risen to his feet,
and she could not ignore his proffered hand. But she
avoided his gaze and quickly withdrew her fingers from
his warm clasp to hurry off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>MADONNA DOLOROSA</h3>
</div>
<p>Blake was cooking supper when, shortly before
sunset, Gowan drove up to the waterhole, with a
pony in lead behind the heavy wagon. Leaving the
wagon with the rope and other articles of his load on
the far side of the creek bed, he watered and picketed
the horses, and came across to the tent with his rifle
and a roll of blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Mr. Blake. Got here in time for supper,
I see,&#8221; he remarked as he unburdened himself. &#8220;Met
Mr. Knowles and the ladies down near the ranch.
They told me about the shooting.&#8221; He faced about
to stare at Ashton&#8217;s bandaged head. &#8220;They told me
you came mighty near getting yours. You shore are
a lucky tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shrugged superciliously. &#8220;The worst of it
is the additional hole in my hat. I see you have a new
one. Is that the latest style on the range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stetson, brand A-1.,&#8221; replied the puncher. &#8220;How
does it strike you, Mr. Blake?&ndash;&ndash;and my new shirt?
Having a dude puncher on our range kind of stirred
up my emulosity. They don&#8217;t have real cowboy attire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
like his at an ordinary shorthorn cow town like Stockchute&ndash;&ndash;but
I did the best I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake made no response to this heavy badinage.
He set the supper on the chuck-box, and laconically
said: &#8220;Come and get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might have known you&#8217;ve been on round-up,&#8221; remarked
Gowan, with an insistent sociability oddly at
variance with his usual taciturn reserve. &#8220;According
to Miss Chuckie, you&#8217;re some rider, and according to
Mr. Knowles, you can shoot. I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing
from you direct about that shooting this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake recounted the affair still more briefly than he
had told it to Knowles.</p>
<p>&#8220;That shore was a mighty close shave,&#8221; commented
the puncher. &#8220;But you haven&#8217;t said what the fellow
looked like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wore ordinary range clothes,&#8221; replied Blake.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see him behind the rocks, and caught only
a glimpse of him as he went around the ridge. His
horse was much the same build and color as Rocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher stared at Ashton with his cold unblinking
eyes. &#8220;You shore picked out a Jim Dandy guide,
Mr. Tenderfoot. According to this, it looks mighty
like he&#8217;s gone and turned hawss thief. Mr. Knowles
says your Rocket hawss has vamoosed. If he&#8217;s moving
to Utah under your ex-guide, it&#8217;ll take some lively
posse to head him. What d&#8217;you say, Mr. Blake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the man is apt soon to come to the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
his rope&ndash;&ndash;after dropping through a trap door,&#8221; said
the engineer.</p>
<p>Gowan looked at him between narrowed eyelids, and
paused with upraised coffee cup to reply: &#8220;A man
that has shown the nerve this one has won&#8217;t let anyone
get close enough to rope him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be either that or a bullet, before long,&#8221; predicted
Blake. &#8220;The badman is getting to be rather
out of date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a bullet,&#8221; admitted Gowan. &#8220;Never any
rope, though, for his kind.&ndash;&ndash;Guess I&#8217;ll turn in. It&#8217;s
something of a drive over to Stockchute and back with
the wagon, and I got up early. You and Ashton might
go on watch until midnight, and turn me out for the rest
of the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed Blake.</p>
<p>The puncher stretched out on his blankets under a
tree, a few yards from the tent. Ashton took the
dishes down to sand-scour them at the pool, while
Blake saw that everything damageable was disposed
safe from the knife-like fangs of the coyotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about keeping watch?&#8221; asked Ashton, when
he returned with the cleansed dishes. &#8220;Shall I take
first or second?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; answered Blake. &#8220;You will need all
the sleep and rest you can get. Tomorrow may be a
hard day. Turn in at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist,&#8221; acquiesced Ashton. &#8220;I still am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
rather weak and dizzy.&#8221; He went to the tent and disappeared.</p>
<p>Blake took the lantern and strolled across to the
wagon, to look at the numerous articles brought by
Gowan. He set the lantern over in the wagon bed on
top of what seemed to be a heap of empty oat sacks,
while he overhauled the load. It included three coils
of rope of a hundred feet each, a keg of railroad spikes,
two dozen picket-pins, two heavy hammers, a pick and
shovel, and a crowbar.</p>
<p>The last three articles had not been ordered by
Blake. The puncher had brought them along, apparently
with a hazy idea that the descent of the ca&ntilde;on
would be something on the order of mining. There
were also in the wagon two five-gallon kerosene cans
to use in carrying water up the mountain, a sack of oats,
Gowan&#8217;s saddle, and two packsaddles.</p>
<p>In shifting one of the packsaddles to get at the hammers,
Blake knocked it against the sack on which the
lantern had been set. The lantern suddenly fell over
on its side. Blake reached in to pick it up, and perceived
that the sack was rising in a mound. He caught
up one of the hammers, and held it poised for a stroke.
From the sack came a muffled rattle. The hammer
descended in a smashing blow.</p>
<p>The sack rose and fell as if something under it was
squirming about convulsively. But to Blake&#8217;s surprise
it did not fall aside and disclose that which was making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the violent movement. The squirming lessened. He
grasped an outer corner of the sack and jerked it upward.
It failed to flip into the air. The lower part
sagged heavily. The squirmer was inside and&ndash;&ndash;the
mouth of the sack was tied fast.</p>
<p>Blake looked at it thoughtfully. After some moments,
he placed the sack where it had lain at first, and
upset the keg of spikes on top of it. He then carefully
examined Gowan&#8217;s saddle; but it told him nothing.
He shook his head doubtfully, and returned to
camp.</p>
<p>Going quietly around to Gowan, he set down the
lantern close before the puncher&#8217;s face and stopped to
light a cigar. Gowan stirred restlessly and rolled half
over, but did not open his eyes. Blake smoked his
cigar, extinguished the lantern, and quietly stretched
out on the edge of the sleeper&#8217;s blankets. In a few
moments he, too, was asleep.</p>
<p>About two o&#8217;clock Gowan stirred and rolled over,
pulling at his blankets. Instantly Blake was wide
awake. The puncher mumbled, drew the blankets
closer about him, and lay quiet. Blake went into the
tent and dozed on his own blankets until roused by the
chill of dawn. He went down for a plunge in the pool,
and was dressed and back at the fireplace, cooking
breakfast, when Gowan started up out of his heavy
slumber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s getting along about that time,&#8221; Blake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
called to him cheerfully. &#8220;You might turn out Ashton.
He has made as good a night of it as you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan had been staring at the dawn, his lean jaw
slack. As Blake spoke, he snapped his mouth shut and
came over to confront the engineer. &#8220;You agreed to
call me at midnight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My apology!&#8221; politely replied Blake. &#8220;I know
how you must feel about it. But I hope you will excuse
me. I saw that you, like Ashton, needed a full
night&#8217;s sleep, and so did not disturb you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher looked away and muttered: &#8220;I&#8217;m
responsible for you to Mr. Knowles. He sent me here
to guard you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. Of course you will say it&#8217;s owing
to no fault of mine that we have come through the
night safely. Well, we have a big day&#8217;s work before
us. May I ask you to call Ashton? Breakfast is
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the puncher sullenly went to rouse the
sleeper. Ashton came out rubbing his eyes; but after
a dip in the pool, he declared himself restored by his
long sleep and ready for a day&#8217;s work. During the
night his bandage had come loose. He would have
tossed it away, but Blake insisted upon re-dressing the
wound. He did so with as much skill and almost as
much gentleness as had his wife.</p>
<p>When Blake and Ashton left the camp, the puncher
was leading the horses across to load their first packs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
The two levelmen walked briskly up the valley, carrying
only enough food and water to last themselves until
evening, when Gowan was to have the camp moved to
the top of High Mesa.</p>
<p>Beginning from his bench-mark at the foot of the
mountain, Blake carried the level line slantingly up
the ridge side. The work was slow and tedious, since
the telescope of the level could never be on a horizontal
line either higher or lower respectively than the top
and bottom of the thirteen-foot rod. This necessitated
setting-up the instrument every few feet during the
steepest part of the ascent.</p>
<p>They saw nothing of Gowan, who had chosen a more
roundabout but easier trail. At midmorning, however,
they were overtaken by Genevieve and Isobel and
Thomas Herbert Vincent Leslie Blake. Knowles had
started for Stockchute to seek the aid of the sheriff and
his Indian prisoners. The ladies divided the ascent
into several stages, riding ahead of the surveyors and
resting in the shade of a rock or pine until the men had
passed them.</p>
<p>Near noon, when the levels had been carried up
close to the top of High Mesa, Gowan rode down to
the party to inquire where the new camp was to be
pitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought up a lot this trip,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;I
can fetch the rest by sundown, if I don&#8217;t have to
meander all over the mesa with these first packs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you leave the packhorses?&#8221; asked
Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up along the ca&ntilde;on where Ashton shot his yearling
deer,&#8221; answered the puncher. &#8220;It&#8217;s about half way
between that gulch where you say you&#8217;re going down
and the bend across from the head of Dry Fork
Gulch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll camp there,&#8221; decided Blake. &#8220;It is on the
shortest trail to that gulch, and you&#8217;ll not have time
to get your second load farther before dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher started back. But Isobel, who had
come riding up with Genevieve, called out to stop him:
&#8220;Wait, Kid. It is almost noon. You must take
lunch with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t leave those hawsses standing with the packs,
Miss Chuckie, if they&#8217;re to make another trip today,&#8221;
he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you unload them and come back along the
edge of the ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; suggested Blake. &#8220;We shall
knock off soon and all go over to give my wife her first
look at the ca&ntilde;on. We can eat lunch there together.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Gowan nodded a willing assent, and he
jogged away, with a half smile on his thin lips. But
that which pleased him had precisely the opposite effect
on Ashton. He did not fancy sharing the companionship
and attention of Miss Knowles with the puncher.
As this interference with his happiness was due to
Blake, he showed a petulant resentment towards the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
engineer that won him the girl&#8217;s sympathetic concern.
She attributed his fretfulness to his wound. Blake
made the same mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done quite enough for the morning, Ashton,
with that head of yours,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re over
the worst now, and can easily run on up to the camp
this afternoon. We shall knock off for a siesta.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t try to make out I&#8217;m a baby!&#8221; snapped
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave your rod here,&#8221; went on Blake, disregarding
the other&#8217;s irascibility. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the level. It may
enable us to see the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started on up the slope beside his wife&#8217;s pony.
Ashton was somewhat mollified when he saw Isobel
linger for him to walk beside her horse. She was
carrying the baby, who, regardless of scenic attractions,
had fallen asleep during the long climb from the lower
mesa. The sight of the child clasped to her bosom
awakened all that was highest in his nature. Concern
over his wound had sobered her usual gay vivacity to
a look of motherly tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he murmured during a pause in
their conversation, &#8220;you make me think of pictures of
the Madonna!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lafe!&#8221; she protested, blushing and as quickly
paling. &#8220;You should not say such a thing. It is
lovely&ndash;&ndash;a beautiful thing to tell me; but&ndash;&ndash;but I do
not deserve it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Madonna!&ndash;&ndash;my Madonna!&#8221; he murmured in
ardent adoration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please! when I&#8217;ve asked you not to!&#8221; she
implored. &#8220;It is not right! I&ndash;&ndash;I am not!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Tears glistened in her soft eyes. She bent over to suppress
a sob that might have awakened the sleeping
infant.</p>
<p>Ashton gazed up at her, wonder and contrition
mingling with his deepening adoration. &#8220;Forgive me,
Miss Chuckie! But I meant it&ndash;&ndash;I feel it! I never
before felt this way towards any girl!... I know I
have no right to say anything now. I am a pennyless
adventurer, a disgraced, disinherited son, a mere cowpuncher
apprentice; but if, by next spring, I shall
have&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, see. They&#8217;re getting such a long way ahead
of us!&#8221; exclaimed the girl, urging her pony to a faster
gait.</p>
<p>The animal started forward with a suddenness that
left Ashton behind. He made no effort to regain his
position beside the girl&#8217;s stirrup. Instead, he lagged
farther and farther in the rear, his face crimson with
mortification and anger. As his chagrin deepened, his
flush became almost feverish and there was a suggestion
of wildness in his flashing eyes. It was as though
his passion was intensifying some injury to his brain
caused by the concussion of the bullet on his skull.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A REAL WOLF</h3>
</div>
<p>When the loiterer came over the second ridge
into view of the booming chasm in the top of
the plateau, he saw the others down near the brink.
The baby had been laid on a soft bed of pine needles,
and Blake was leading the ladies down to look over
into the abyss, one on each arm.</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s chagrin flared into jealous hate. He felt
certain that the girl was quite capable of strolling
along the extreme edge of the precipice without a trace
of giddiness. Yet now she was clinging to Blake even
more closely than was Genevieve. There was more
than apprehension in the clasp of her little brown hand
on the engineer&#8217;s shoulder. Her cheek brushed his
sleeve.</p>
<p>The anger of the onlooker was so intense that he
did not see Gowan riding towards him from the left.
The puncher dismounted and came forward, his cold
gaze fixed on Ashton&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re beginning to savvy it, too,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>Ashton confronted him, vainly attempting to mask
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
his telltale look and color with a show of hauteur. &#8220;I
never discuss personal matters with acquaintances of
your stamp,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; coolly deplored Gowan. &#8220;Maybe
you&#8217;ve heard the saying about cutting off your nose
to spite your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to go it alone, I can&#8217;t stop you,&#8221; replied
the puncher. &#8220;Needn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m sucking
around you for any favors or friendship. If this was
my range, I would run you off it so fast you&#8217;d reach
Stockchute with your tongue hanging out like a dog&#8217;s.
That&#8217;s how much I like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The feeling is fully reciprocated, I assure you,&#8221;
rejoined Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Now what&#8217;re we going to do about
him?&ndash;&ndash;each play a lone hand, or make it pardners
for this deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;fail to understand,&#8221; hesitated Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; jeeringly contradicted the puncher.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a three-cornered fight. You see it now, even
if you have been too big a fool to see it before. We
can settle ours after. But I&#8217;m free to own up to it
that you&#8217;re a striped skunk if you won&#8217;t work with
me first to get rid of him. Look at him now&ndash;&ndash;and
him married!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s flush deepened to purple. &#8220;Married!&ndash;&ndash;yes,
married!&#8221; he choked out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right alongside his wife, too!&#8221; Gowan thrust the
goad deeper. &#8220;You&#8217;d think even that brand of skunk
would have more decency. Not that his wife is any
friend of mine, like she is yours. But for a man with
such a wife and baby ... with Miss Chuckie!
The&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan ended with a string of oaths so virulent that
even Ashton&#8217;s half-mad anger was checked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I fear that we&ndash;&ndash;Perhaps
it&#8217;s not so bad as it appears!&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bah!</i>&#8221; disgustedly sneered the puncher, and he
strode on ahead, leaving Ashton torn between rage and
doubt and terror of his own furious jealousy.</p>
<p>The others continued to stand on a flat ledge that
here formed the lip of the ca&ntilde;on. Genevieve was
trembling with awed delight. Her husband and the
girl appeared more calm, but they were drinking in the
grandeur of the tremendous gorge below them with no
less intense appreciation of its gloomy vastness.</p>
<p>Upstream, to their left, the precipices jutted so far
out from each wall of the ca&ntilde;on that they overlapped,
a thousand or fifteen hundred feet from the top. But
downstream the upper part of the chasm flared to a
width that permitted the noonday sun to penetrate part
way down through the blue-black shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-o-oh!&#8221; sighed Genevieve, for the tenth time,
and she clung tighter than ever to the strong arm of
her husband. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fearfully, fearfully delightful?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
It makes the soles of my feet tingle to look at
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That tickly feeling!&#8221; exclaimed Isobel. &#8220;I often
ride up here to the ca&ntilde;on, I do so love to feel that way!
Only with me it&#8217;s like ants crawling up and down my
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-o-oh!&#8221; again sighed Genevieve. &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it
so overpowers one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure some ca&ntilde;on,&#8221; admitted her husband.
&#8220;That French artist Dor&eacute; ought to have seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we had a copy of Dante&#8217;s Inferno to read
here on the brink!&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It always reminds me of Coleridge&#8217;s poem,&#8221; murmured
Isobel, and she quoted in an awed whisper:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br />
Through caverns measureless to man,<br />
Down to the sunless sea.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately for us, this is a ca&ntilde;on, not a string of
measureless caverns,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;It can be measured,
one way or another. If I had a transit, I could
calculate the depth at any point where the water shows&ndash;&ndash;triangulate
with a vertical angle. But it would
cause a long delay to send on for a transit. We shall
first try to chain down at that gulch break.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve shrank back from the verge of the precipice
and drew the others after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I did not dream it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
so fearful. One has to see to realize! You will not
go down&ndash;&ndash;promise me you will not go down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, little woman,&#8221; reproached Blake.
&#8220;What&#8217;s become of my partner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But baby&ndash;&ndash;? If you should leave him fatherless!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better that than for him to have a father who is
a quitter! Just wait, Sweetheart. That break looks
much less overwhelming than these sheer cliffs. You
know I shall not attempt anything foolhardy. If it is
not possible to get down without too great risk, I shall
give it up and send for a transit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will you?&#8221; exclaimed Isobel, hardly less apprehensive
than his wife. &#8220;Why not wait anyway
until you can send for your transit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I cannot triangulate the bottom within
half a mile upstream from where the tunnel would
have to be located. That roar and the wildness of
the water wherever we can see it is proof that it is
flowing down a heavy grade. At the point where I
triangulated it might be above the level of Dry Mesa,
and way below the mesa here at the tunnel site.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could triangulate at the first place where the
bottom can be seen, beyond here,&#8221; suggested Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose it proved to be lower than Dry Mesa,
wouldn&#8217;t that still leave us up in the air?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Like this&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>He pulled out his notebook and drew a rough
sketch.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/depths-003.jpg' alt='' title='' width='192' height='68' /><br />
</div>
<p>&#8220;I see, Dear,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;When do you plan
to go down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you wait until we come up from the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mr. Knowles will no doubt be back by
then. He can bring you out early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall come early, anyway,&#8221; said Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; added Genevieve. She drew a deep
breath. &#8220;I shall see the place before you attempt to
descend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband nodded reassuringly and looked
around to where Gowan and Ashton stood waiting,
several yards from one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;About lunch time, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Mr.
Gowan will wish to be starting soon to bring up his
second load.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the suggestion, the ladies hastened to spread out
their own lunch and the one brought by Blake. When
called by Isobel, Gowan came forward to join the party,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
with rather less than his usual reserve in his speech and
manner.</p>
<p>Ashton was the last to seat himself on the springy
cushion of brown pine needles, and he sat throughout
the meal in moody silence. Blake and the ladies attributed
this to the fatigue of working through the long
hot morning while suffering from his unhealed wound.
He repulsed the sympathetic attentions of the Blakes.
But he could not long continue to resist the kindly concern
of the girl. After lunch she made him lie down
in the shade while she bathed his wound with a good
part of the small supply of water remaining in the canteens.</p>
<p>Gowan had been asking questions about the work.
Blake explained at some length why he considered it
necessary not only to descend into the ca&ntilde;on but to
carry the line of levels down along the bed of the subterranean
stream to this point opposite Dry Fork
Gulch. When Isobel drew apart with Ashton the
puncher did not look at them, though his eyes narrowed
to slits and his mouth straightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shore have nerve to tackle it, Mr. Blake,&#8221; he
commented. &#8220;Everything alive that I know of that&#8217;s
ever gone down into Deep Ca&ntilde;on hasn&#8217;t ever come up
again, except it had wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll prove that the rule has an exception,&#8221; replied
Blake, smiling away the reawakened apprehension
of his wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>Gowan shook his head doubtfully, and strolled
down the slope to peer into the ca&ntilde;on. The level was
directly in his path, set up firmly on its tripod, about
six feet from the brink. The puncher stopped beside
it to squint through the telescope.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have one&ndash;&ndash;peach of a time seeing anything
through this contraption down there,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see even right here in the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The telescope is out of focus,&#8221; explained Blake.
&#8220;Turn that screw on the side.&#8221; Gowan twisted a
protruding thumbscrew. &#8220;Not that&ndash;&ndash;the one above
it,&#8221; directed Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stop to fool now,&#8221; replied the puncher.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to hustle along.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started hastily around between the level and the
precipice. The toe of his boot struck hard against the
iron toe of the outer tripod-leg. He stumbled and
sprawled forward on his hands and knees. Behind
him the instrument toppled over towards the brink.</p>
<p>Genevieve cried out in alarm at Gowan&#8217;s fall. Her
husband sprang to the rescue&ndash;&ndash;not of the puncher,
but of the level. It had crashed down with its head
to the chasm, and was sliding out over the brink.
Blake barely caught it by the tip of one of the legs as
it swung up for the plunge. He drew it back and set
it up to see what damage had been done to the head.
Gowan watched him, tight-lipped.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is luck!&#8221; exclaimed the engineer, after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
swift examination. &#8220;Nothing broken&ndash;&ndash;only knocked
out of adjustment. I can fix that in half an hour. She
struck with the telescope turned sideways. You must
have set the clamp screw.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;Wish the&ndash;&ndash;infernal
machine had gone plumb down to hell!&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;It came near tripping me over the edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My apology,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I spraddled the
tripod purposely to keep it from being upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kid, you&#8217;ve hurt yourself,&#8221; called Isobel, as
the puncher began to wrap a kerchief about his hand.
&#8220;Come here and let me bandage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Two babies are enough for
you to coddle at one time. I&#8217;ve got to hit out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned his back on Blake and hurried up to his
horse. The engineer followed as far as the nearest
tree, where he set up the instrument in the shade and
began to adjust it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing she has platinum crosshairs,&#8221; he said
to Ashton. &#8220;A fall like that would have been certain
to break the old-style spiderweb hairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton did not reply. He was absorbed in a murmured
conversation with Isobel. Blake completed the
adjustments of the level and stretched out beside his
wife to play with his gurgling son. A half hour of
this completed the two hours that he had set apart for
the noon rest. He placed the baby back in his wife&#8217;s
lap and stood up to stretch his powerful frame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How about it, Ashton?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;Think
you feel fit to rod this afternoon? Don&#8217;t hesitate to
say no, if that&#8217;s the right answer. I expect my wife
and Miss Chuckie, between them, can help me carry
the line as far as the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do it alone,&#8221; interposed the girl. &#8220;Let
them both stay here and rest all afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Chuckie. I can and shall do my work,&#8221;
insisted Ashton, springing up with unexpected briskness
for one who had appeared so fatigued. &#8220;It is
you and Mrs. Blake who must stay here to rest&ndash;&ndash;unless
you wish to keep us company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might we not go to the new camp and put it in
order?&#8221; suggested Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if that outlaw should come sneaking back?&#8221;
objected Ashton. &#8220;It seems to me you should keep
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not trouble us,&#8221; replied Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet if he should? Anyway, Blake and I saw a
wolf up here the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A real wolf! Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Blake. &#8220;Over in the ravine the
other side of the head of Dry Fork Gulch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may attack you,&#8221; argued Ashton.</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re still a tenderfoot to
think a wolf wouldn&#8217;t know better than that. Wish
he didn&#8217;t! It would mean the saving of a half dozen
calves this winter.&#8221; She flashed out her long-barreled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
automatic pistol and knocked a cone from the tree
above Blake&#8217;s head with a swiftly aimed shot.</p>
<p>Blake caught the cone as it fell and looked at the
bullet hole through its center. &#8220;Unless that was an
accident, I should call it some shooting,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accident!&#8221; she called back. &#8220;Stand sideways
and see what happens to your cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks. I&#8217;ll take your word for it. Just
lit this one, and I&#8217;ve only a few left. By by, Tommy!
Don&#8217;t let the wolves eat mamma and the poor little
cowlady!&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up the level and started off at a swinging
stride. Ashton followed several paces behind. His
face was sullen and heavy, but in their merriment over
Blake&#8217;s banter, the ladies failed to observe his expression.</p>
<p>They rested for a while longer. Then, after venturing
down for another awed look into the abyss, they
rode along, parallel with the stupendous rift, to the
place selected for the new camp. As Gowan had
brought up the tent in one of the first packs, the ladies
pitched it on the level top of the ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is real camping!&#8221; delightedly exclaimed
Genevieve, as they set to gathering leafy twigs for bedding
and dry branches for fuel. &#8220;How I wish we
could stay all night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can, if you wish,&#8221; replied Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we, really?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our men often sleep out in the open, this time of
year. We shall take the tent for ourselves. Won&#8217;t it
be fun! But will Thomas be all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can manage with what I have until tomorrow
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do you think they will be down in the
ca&ntilde;on?&#8221; the girl inquired.</p>
<p>Genevieve shuddered. &#8220;I wish I could tell! If
only Tom finds that he cannot get down at all, how
thankful I shall be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;Lafe!&#8221; murmured the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that they may be unable to do it in
one day,&#8221; went on Genevieve apprehensively&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Down,
down into those dreadful depths, and then
along the river, all the way to where the tunnel is to
be, and back again, and then up the awful cliffs!
Surely they cannot finish in one day! Of course they
will succeed&ndash;&ndash;Tom can do anything, <i>anything</i>! Yet
how I dread the very thought&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must prepare to stay right here on High Mesa
until they do finish!&#8221; declared Isobel. &#8220;It will be
impossible to go back to the ranch tomorrow if they
are still in that frightful place! Kid will have to take
the hawsses down to the waterhole. He shall go on
home, and tomorrow morning fetch us cream and eggs
and everything you need. They will have to be told
at the ranch; and if Daddy has returned, he will come
up to help and be with us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You dear girl! The more I think of this terrible
descent, the more I dread it. I feel a presentiment
that&ndash;&ndash;But I must try to be brave and not interfere
with Tom&#8217;s work! It will be a great comfort to have
your father with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy will surely come if he has returned. Isn&#8217;t
he kind and good? He couldn&#8217;t have done more to
make me happy if he had been my own real father!&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve smiled into the girl&#8217;s glowing face.
&#8220;Yes, dear. Yet I am far from surprised, since <i>you</i>
are the daughter he wished to make happy. I was
more surprised to have him tell me you were adopted.
You have never said a word about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;you see, I did not happen to,&#8221; confusedly
murmured the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chuckie Knowles is not your real name,&#8221; Genevieve
gently reproached her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is the pet name Daddy gave me. My real
one is&ndash;&ndash;Isobel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isobel&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Daddy&#8217;s sister, in Denver, always calls me
that. But here on the ranch&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isobel&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; repeated Genevieve, with a rising inflection.</p>
<p>The color ebbed from the girl&#8217;s face, but she answered
steadily: &#8220;Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;Isobel&ndash;&ndash;Knowles. I
am Daddy&#8217;s daughter. I have no other father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is-o-bel&ndash;&ndash;Is-o-bel,&#8221; Genevieve intoned the name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
musically. &#8220;It has a beautiful sound. I had a friend
at school&ndash;&ndash;Isabella&ndash;&ndash;but we always called her
Belle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl suddenly faced away from her companion,
and darted to meet Blake and Ashton, who were bringing
the line of levels up over the ridge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE TEMPTATION</h3>
</div>
<p>When the ladies explained their plans for remaining
in camp on High Mesa, Blake gave a ready
assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jenny. It&#8217;ll be something like old
times. Can&#8217;t scare you up any lions or fever, leopards
or cyclones; but you may see that wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should welcome all savage Africa if it would rid
us of this awful ca&ntilde;on!&#8221; replied his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please give it up?&#8221; begged Isobel.
&#8220;I am to blame for your coming here. If anything
should happen to you, I&ndash;&ndash;I could never forgive myself&ndash;&ndash;never!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake looked at the two lovely, anxious faces before
him, and smiled gravely. &#8220;There you go again, and
you have yet to see that gulch. But even if you find
that it looks dangerous, you wouldn&#8217;t want me to let
a little risk interfere with my work, would you?
Think of the fools who climb the highest and steepest
mountains just for sport. I am going down there because
it is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it?&#8221; the girl half sobbed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Someone must do it, sooner or later,&#8221; he replied,
and he took his wife&#8217;s hand in his big palm. &#8220;Come,
little woman, speak up. Do you want your husband to
be a shirker and quitter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not, Tom. Yet one should be reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had enough experience in climbing to know
not to attempt the impossible, Sweetheart,&#8221; he assured
her. &#8220;The worst looking places are not always the
most dangerous. I promise you to take only reasonable
risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we time enough to look at the place this
afternoon?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>Blake glanced at the sun, and nodded. &#8220;The riding
is good. We can get back long before dark.
Ashton, you had better stretch out and rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shall go with you,&#8221; replied Ashton, his lips
set in as firm lines as Blake&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot go, Lafe, unless you agree to ride my
pony,&#8221; said Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to have Gowan call me a baby
again,&#8221; he objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will need all your strength tomorrow,&#8221; predicted
Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must ride,&#8221; insisted Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well&ndash;&ndash;to please you,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;We
shall take turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake again looked at the sun. &#8220;As long as we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
going, we may as well carry forward the line of levels.
We can take long turns nearly all the way, so there
will be little delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I shall rod for you!&#8221; delightedly exclaimed
Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only part of the time,&#8221; qualified Ashton with a
sharpness that the others attributed to his zeal to serve
her.</p>
<p>He filled his canteen from one of the cans of water
brought up by Gowan, and rinsed out the mouths and
nostrils of the thirsty ponies. This done, he and
Genevieve mounted, and the party started off on a
route parallel with the ca&ntilde;on, which here trended back
away from the edge of the plateau.</p>
<p>They soon came to where the surface of the mesa
was slashed with gulleys and ravines, all running down
into the ca&ntilde;on. Blake swung away from the ca&ntilde;on,
in order to head the worst of these ravines or to cross
them where they were less precipitous. Presently,
however, he struck in again towards the great rift
along the flank of a high barren ridge. At last he led
over the ridge and down to the side of a very large
ravine where it pitched into the ca&ntilde;on at an angle little
less steep than the descent of Dry Fork Gulch.</p>
<p>The line of levels, as Blake had foretold, had been
an easy one to run. It was stopped on the corner of
a shelf of rock that jutted out above the gorge. Having
provided a soft nest for the baby, the four went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
out on the shelf and peered down the dizzy slope into
the black shadows of the depths.</p>
<p>The two ladies drew back shuddering. Blake
looked about at them and seeing their troubled faces,
sought to quiet their dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not looked close enough,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;With spikes and ropes, the worst of this will be comparatively
easy. There are ledges and crevices all the
way down. You cannot see the lower half. When I
was here with Gowan and Mr. Knowles, the sun was
shining to the bottom. The lower half of the descent
is much less steep than this you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve smiled trustfully. &#8220;Oh, if you say it is
safe, Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall take down the rope and all the spikes
we can carry,&#8221; he explained in further reassurance.
&#8220;At the worst places a spike and a piece of the rope
will not only let us down safely, but can be left for our
ascent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it will be all right!&#8221; sighed Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;For him&ndash;&ndash;yes!&#8221; broke in Ashton, his voice harsh
and strained. He was cringing back, white-faced,
from the edge of the gulch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lafe!&#8221; exclaimed the girl. &#8220;If Tom&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Blake goes down, surely you can&#8217;t mean that
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s used to climbing&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not!&#8221; Ashton
sought to excuse himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of course it is not
right to ask you to do it if you suffer from vertigo. I
shall ask Kid to take your place. If he refuses, Daddy
will do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may mean delay,&#8221; remarked Blake. &#8220;If
that scoundrel really is headed for Utah, your father
may not be back for several days. Yet he asked me to
settle this matter as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if Kid will not go down with you, I shall,&#8221;
declared the girl, her blue eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no indeed, dear!&#8221; protested Genevieve. &#8220;It
is simply impossible! You shall not do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall, unless Kid&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not ask him!&#8221; interposed Ashton, his
pale face suddenly flushing a hot red. &#8220;I am going
down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, Lafayette?&#8221; cried Genevieve. &#8220;That
is very brave and&ndash;&ndash;and kind of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you have no experience in climbing?&#8221; objected
Isobel in a tone that transmuted the young man&#8217;s
angry flush into a glow of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t inexperienced climbers go up the Alps with
guides?&#8221; he nonchalantly replied. &#8220;I can trust Blake
to get me safe to the bottom. He will need me in his
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Lafe!&#8221; commended Blake.</p>
<p>It was the first time that he had ever addressed
Ashton so familiarly. He accompanied it with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
proffer of his hand. But Ashton did not look at him.
He was basking in the frankly admiring gaze of Miss
Knowles.</p>
<p>The party returned in the same manner that they
had come out, for Isobel firmly refused to permit Ashton
to walk. Blake allowed her to set the pace, and
she chose such a rapid one that they reached camp a
full half hour before sunset.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as they were sitting down to a
hastily prepared supper, Gowan appeared with the second
load from the lower camp. Blake and Ashton
sprang up to loosen the packs of the sweating, panting
horses. The puncher swung down from his saddle, not
to assist them, but to remonstrate with Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been expecting to meet you, all the way up, Miss
Chuckie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you staying too late?
You won&#8217;t get home before long after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Blake and I are not going down tonight,
Kid,&#8221; replied the girl, and she explained the change of
plans.</p>
<p>Gowan listened attentively, though without commenting
either by look or word. When she had quite
finished, he asked a single question: &#8220;Think your
Daddy won&#8217;t mind, Miss Chuckie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will understand that we simply can&#8217;t leave here
until Lafe and&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Blake are safe up out of the
ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You&#8217;re the boss,&#8221; he acquiesced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
&#8220;Just write out a list of what you want. I&#8217;ll take all
the hawsses down to the waterhole, and go on to the
ranch. You can look for me back at sunup. The
moon rises between three and four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Genevieve, will you make out the list? Sit down
and eat, Kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just a snack, Miss Chuckie. Wouldn&#8217;t stop
for that if the hawsses didn&#8217;t know the trail well
enough to go down in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen any sign of the murderer?&#8221; inquired
Ashton.</p>
<p>Gowan drained the cup of scalding hot coffee handed
to him by Isobel, and answered jeeringly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry, Tenderfoot. He won&#8217;t try to get you tonight.
If he came back today, he saw me around. If he
comes back tonight, he won&#8217;t think of climbing High
Mesa to look for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake came to the puncher with a list written by
himself and his wife on a leaf from his fieldbook.
Gowan folded it in his hatband, washed down the last
mouthful of bread and ham that he had been bolting,
and went to shift his saddle to Isobel&#8217;s pony, the youngest
and freshest of the horses. In two minutes he
was riding away down the ridge, willingly followed by
the four other horses. They knew as well as he that
they were returning to the waterhole.</p>
<p>As the campers again sat down to their supper Isobel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
paused with the coffeepot upraised. &#8220;Genevieve,&#8221;
she inquired, &#8220;did you put cream on the list?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, my dear. It did not occur to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor may it to Yuki. He will be sure to send
eggs and butter, but unless he thinks to save tonight&#8217;s
cream&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll run and tell Kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton sprang up ahead of her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll catch him,&#8221;
he said, and sprinted down the ridge.</p>
<p>Racing around a thicket of scrub oak, he caught
sight of Gowan more than an eighth of a mile ahead.
He whistled repeatedly. At last Gowan twisted about
in the saddle, and drew rein. He did not turn back,
but made Ashton come all the way to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s wanted?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cream,&#8221; panted Ashton. &#8220;Miss Chuckie says&ndash;&ndash;tell
Yuki.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore pop, I&#8217;ll bring all there is,&#8221; replied Gowan.
Ashton started back. &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said the puncher.
&#8220;I want to say something to you, and here&#8217;s the
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About him. I want you to keep a mighty close
watch tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said that the murderer would not&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bah!</i> What does he count in this deal? It&#8217;s this
engineer. I&#8217;ve been chewing it over all afternoon.
Miss Chuckie is as innocent and trusting as a lamb,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
spite of her winterings in Denver, and she&#8217;s plumb
locoed over him, reading so much about him in the
reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, it does not necessarily follow&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t it, though!&#8221; broke in the puncher. &#8220;Guess
you didn&#8217;t find it any funnier than I did seeing her
hanging onto his shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse him!&#8221; cried Ashton, his jealousy flaring at
the remembrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking!&#8221; approved Gowan. &#8220;That
shows you like her like I do. You&#8217;re not going to
stand for her losing her fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By his flooding us off our range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;as for that, I have been thinking it over.
She told me Mr. Knowles owns five sections. If
water is put on them&ndash;&ndash;Western Colorado fruit lands
are very valuable, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie. Water can&#8217;t make five sections
worth a range like ours. But supposing it could&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
the puncher leaned towards Ashton, his eyes glaring
with the cold malignancy of a striking rattlesnake&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;supposing
it could, how about us letting her lose her
good name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; gasped Ashton. &#8220;It can&#8217;t come to
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t it? can&#8217;t it? Where&#8217;s your eyes? And him
a married man! The&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Gowan cursed horribly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You really believe it!&#8221; cried Ashton, convinced
by the other&#8217;s outburst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe it? I know it!&#8221; declared Gowan. &#8220;If
you thought half as much of her as I do&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do!&ndash;&ndash;not half, but a hundred times more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear it! I&#8217;d do anything for her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except save her from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! How can I? Tell me how!&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher bent nearer to the half-frenzied man.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going down that gulch with him. Suppose
a spike gets knocked out or a rope breaks or a loose
rock gets pushed over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; cried Ashton, putting his hands over his
eyes. &#8220;That would be murder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bah!</i> You&#8217;d make a dog sick! Willing to do
anything for her&ndash;&ndash;except save her from him! And
nothing to it but just an accident that&#8217;s just as like as
not to happen anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;murder!&#8221; shudderingly muttered Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder a skunk,&#8221; sneered Gowan. &#8220;If saving
her from him isn&#8217;t a case of justifiable homicide, what
is? Don&#8217;t you get the idea? Just a likely accident,
down there where nobody can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton dropped his hands, half clenched, to his
sides. Beads of cold sweat were gathering and running
down his drawn face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I agree to get out of the way and give you
clear running?&#8221; tempted Gowan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see how much I like her. You rid
her of him, and I&#8217;ll let you have her for doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it over&ndash;&ndash;and watch him mighty close tonight,&#8221;
advised the tempter.</p>
<p>A red flush leaped into Ashton&#8217;s face. Gowan
struck his spurs into his horse&#8217;s flank and loped away.</p>
<p>Ashton stood motionless. The puncher disappeared
down the mountain side. The twilight faded
and darkness closed down about the tortured man.
He stood there motionless, his convulsed face alternately
flushing and paling, his eyes now clouding, now
burning with rage and hate.</p>
<p>When at last he returned to the camp he kept beyond
the circle of firelight. Hurriedly he rolled up
in his blankets for the night, muttering something
about his head and his need of rest for the next day&#8217;s
work. The others accepted the explanation without
question. They formed a cheerful domestic group
about the fire from which he was shut out by his passion.</p>
<p>The ladies withdrew into the tent at an early hour.
Blake strolled around the camp until after nine o&#8217;clock,
but finally came with his blankets and companionably
rolled up near Ashton. He was soon fast asleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
But Ashton lay tossing until after midnight. Weariness
at last weighed down the lids of his hot eyes and
numbed his tortured brain. He sank into a feverish
sleep haunted with evil dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>BLIND LOVE</h3>
</div>
<p>At sunrise the harassed dreamer awoke to find
Gowan gazing down at him somberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you here?&#8221; he exclaimed, starting up on
his elbow. &#8220;What is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He checked himself and
muttered brokenly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been dreaming&ndash;&ndash;horrible
nightmares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down there overhauling his outfit,&#8221; said
Gowan. &#8220;Hope you&#8217;ve thought the matter over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My answer must be the same. I cannot do it, I
cannot!&#8221; replied Ashton. He spoke hurriedly, as if
afraid to linger on the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;not to save her and have me give
her to you?&#8221; asked Gowan.</p>
<p>Ashton clenched his hands and bent over in an agony
of doubt and indecision.</p>
<p>&#8220;You devil!&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Because I&#8217;m willing to give her up, in
order to see her saved?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you shoot him, if you&#8217;re so anxious?&#8221;
queried Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And hang for it,&#8221; retorted the puncher. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
can do it with an accident, and no risk. Anyway,
that&#8217;ll make things easier for his wife&ndash;&ndash;to have him
meet a natural death. Won&#8217;t be anything said about
why he was taken off. She hasn&#8217;t begun to suspect
what&#8217;s going on between him and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan paused, looked at the tent, and concluded:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done my part. I won&#8217;t say any more. But
just you remember what I&#8217;ve told you. You won&#8217;t
run any risk. Mr. Knowles hasn&#8217;t come back yet.
There&#8217;ll be only them and me along, and we won&#8217;t
be able to see you do it. Just remember what it will
mean to her&ndash;&ndash;just remember that&ndash;&ndash;when you get
him where a shove or a loosened spike&ndash;&ndash;Savvy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to loosen the diamond hitch of the packs
that he had brought with him from the ranch. Ashton
sank back and lay brooding until the girl came from
the tent and called to inquire how he felt. Too
wretched to care about his appearance, he rose and
went over to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed at sight of his haggard face.
&#8220;You are ill!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only an attack of indigestion and loss of sleep&ndash;&ndash;something
I often have,&#8221; he lied. &#8220;A cup of coffee
will set me up. Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m strong&ndash;&ndash;head
doesn&#8217;t bother me at all this morning, except a numb
feeling inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall dress the wound at once, while the coffee is
boiling,&#8221; she replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>He would have objected. She silenced him with a
look that acted on his chafed spirit like oil upon a
burn. Her kind, almost tender voice and the soft
touch of her fingers on his head soothed his anguish
and seemed to counteract the poison instilled by Gowan.
He began to doubt the puncher and the witness of his
own eyes.</p>
<p>When Blake and his wife came to breakfast, Ashton
was so cheerful that they hardly noticed the traces
of haggardness that yet lingered in his face. Blake at
once centered the attention of all by explaining his
plans for the exploration of the ca&ntilde;on. In addition
to the surveyor&#8217;s chain, a hammer, and the rope and
spikes,&ndash;&ndash;which were to be used only in making the
descent,&ndash;&ndash;he and Ashton were to carry the level and
rod and a quantity of food. At the suggestion of Isobel,
he agreed to take her father&#8217;s revolver and fire it
at intervals, on the chance that the watchers above
might see the flash of the shots and so be able to follow
the progress of the explorers down in the depths.</p>
<p>Genevieve quickly thought out signals to be given
in response. If at night, a torch was to be cast down
into the chasm; if in the daytime, a white flag, made of
a sheet sent by Yuki, was to be waved out over the
brink. As the explorers might become confused in
the gloom of the ca&ntilde;on bottom, the point of the bend
opposite Dry Fork Gulch was to be marked by a beacon
fire built on the verge of the ca&ntilde;on wall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>Blake had already arranged everything that he and
Ashton were to take down with them. Immediately
after breakfast the outfit was fastened on the packhorses,
together with food, water and blankets for
those who were to remain on the heights. The ladies
were determined to keep above the explorers at all
points where the rim of the ca&ntilde;on could be approached.
Gowan was to fetch and carry for them and take the
horses down to the pool for water at night.</p>
<p>Within half an hour after breakfast the party was
jogging away from camp, fully equipped for the great
undertaking. Gowan was afoot. His horse, as well
as the regular pack animals, was heavily loaded with
stores. He walked with Isobel, who had insisted that
Ashton should ride her pony. Blake strode along at
his wife&#8217;s stirrup, carrying his son in a clasp as tender
as it was strong.</p>
<p>The engineer was the only cheerful member of the
party. Even Thomas Herbert, that best tempered of
babies, was peevish and fretful. He was instinctively
reflexing the suppressed nervousness and anxiety of his
mother. Gowan and Ashton were as gloomy in look
and speech as the shadowy depths of the ca&ntilde;on. Isobel
bravely sought to respond to Blake&#8217;s confidence in
the favorable outcome of the survey; but her smile,
like Genevieve&#8217;s, was forced and her eyes were
troubled.</p>
<p>They reached the point of attack as the rays of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
morning sun were beginning to strike down into the
side gorge. This was as Blake had planned. He at
once began to direct the preparations for the descent,
himself doing the lion&#8217;s share of the work.</p>
<p>A long detour to a point higher up the ravine offered
an easy descent of its bottom to the place where it
pitched steeply into the ca&ntilde;on. Blake preferred to
take a short cut down the almost vertical side of the
gulch. The three pieces of rope, each a hundred feet
long, were knotted together and used to lower a grass-padded
package containing all the equipment of the
explorers except the level. The bundle was lodged
on a broad shelf of rock, over two hundred and fifty
feet down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first measurement,&#8221; remarked Blake, as he
subtracted from three hundred feet the length of the
line left above the edge of the cliff. He jotted down
the remainder in his notebook, and nodded to Ashton,
who, with Gowan and Isobel, was holding the end of
the rope. &#8220;You see why I had Mr. Gowan bring
gloves and chaps and your leggins. We will make
the line fast around that rock, and follow our outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared, slack jawed. &#8220;Really, you cannot
mean&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Why not?&#8221; asked Blake. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
to a slide like this except the look of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom!&#8221; breathlessly cried Genevieve. &#8220;Are
you sure&ndash;&ndash;quite sure!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I&#8217;m sure, little woman,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;There&#8217;s not the slightest danger. This is a new
manila rope, and the package, with all those spikes in
it, weighs as much as I do. That gives us a sure test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have known!&#8221; she sighed her relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still it does look a bit stiff for a start-off,&#8221; he
admitted. &#8220;If Lafe prefers, he can go around and
come down the ravine bed. I shall slide the line and
be getting the outfit in shape for shooting the chutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the rope?&#8221; asked Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to drop it to me as soon as I get down
and stand from under,&#8221; directed Blake. He examined
with minute care the loop and knot with which Gowan
and Isobel had made the rope fast around the point
of rock. Having satisfied himself that the knot was
perfectly secure, he turned to his wife and opened his
arms. &#8220;Now, Sweetheart! Wish us good luck and
a quick journey!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan and Ashton drew back and looked away as
Genevieve flung herself on her husband&#8217;s broad chest,
unable to restrain her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, little woman,&#8221; he soothed, patting her
shoulder. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of, and you
know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;if only we could see you down there!&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, part of the time, with your glasses.
And you&#8217;ll be sure to see the flash of some of my shots.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
That&#8217;s all that I&#8217;m worrying about&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll be skirting
along the ca&ntilde;on rim. Promise me you&#8217;ll not go
near the edge except where the footing is perfectly
safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Dear. I shall have Thomas to remind me
to be careful. But you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have the thought of you both to keep me
from being rash. Remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not be rash, I know,&#8221; she answered, smiling
up at him bravely. &#8220;You will go and come back
to us soon. Now kiss me and Thomas. I shall not
detain you from your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spoken like my partner,&#8221; he quietly praised her.</p>
<p>Both by tone and manner he was plainly seeking to
ease the parting to the calmness of an ordinary farewell.
His wife responded to this, outwardly at least.
Not so Isobel. From the moment he had turned to
Genevieve, the girl had betrayed a rapidly increasing
agitation.</p>
<p>He went to kiss his baby, who had fallen asleep
during the last half mile of the trip and lay sprawled
in the shade of a bowlder. As he came back, Genevieve
lingered beside the child, as if half fearful of watching
her husband begin his dizzy descent of the rope.</p>
<p>Isobel was standing close to the verge, her bosom
heaving with quick-drawn breaths, her excited face
flushing and paling in rapid alternation. Blake had
pulled on his left glove, but had kept his right hand
bare for her. As he held it out he looked up from
the taut rope at his feet and saw her excessively agitated
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Chuckie!&#8221; he remonstrated, &#8220;you&#8217;re
not going to break down now. You see how Jenny
takes it. There&#8217;s nothing to fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but, Tom!&#8221; she panted, &#8220;you&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t
understand! you don&#8217;t know! It&#8217;s not merely the danger!
It&#8217;s the dreadful thought that if you&ndash;&ndash;if you
should not&ndash;&ndash;come back&ndash;&ndash;and I hadn&#8217;t told you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Told me?&#8221; he echoed in hushed wonderment as
her anguished soul looked out at him through her wide
eyes and he sensed the first vague foreshadowing of
the truth. &#8220;You have something to tell me&ndash;&ndash;your
voice!&ndash;&ndash;your eyes!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see it! You know me!&#8221; she gasped, and she
flung herself into his arms. Straining herself to him
in half frantic ecstasy, she murmured in a broken whisper:
&#8220;Yes! I am&ndash;&ndash;am Belle! It is wicked and
selfish to tell you; but to have you go down there without
first&ndash;&ndash;I could not bear it! Yet I&ndash;&ndash;I shall not
drag you down&ndash;&ndash;disgrace you. Never that! I&#8217;ll
go away!... Oh, Tom! dear Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had stood dumfounded by the revelation of her
identity. At first he could not speak; hardly could he
think. His eyes stared into hers with a dazed look.
But before she could finish her impassioned declaration
of self-abnegation he roused from his bewilderment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
and his great arms closed about her quivering
body. He crushed her to him and pressed his lips
upon her white forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Belle!&ndash;&ndash;poor little Belle!... But why? Tell
me why? All this time, and you never showed by a
single word or look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; she sought to defend herself from the
tender reproach. &#8220;I did, but I&ndash;&ndash;I was afraid to
tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face flamed scarlet with shame. She
sought to draw away from him. &#8220;Let me go, Tom!
oh, please, let me go! I am a selfish, wicked girl! I
have done it! I have done it! Now there is no help
for it! She must be told&ndash;&ndash;all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all, Tom! I cannot deny Mary! She saved
me! I believe she is in Heaven. She could not help
doing what she did. She could not help it, Tom&ndash;&ndash;and
she saved me! I must give you up&ndash;&ndash;go away;
but I can never, never deny my sister!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake swung half around with the quivering girl,
and looked over her downbent head at his wife. Genevieve
stood almost within arm&#8217;s-length of them. He
met her gaze, and immediately pushed the girl out towards
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Belle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is all right. Here
is Jenny waiting for you. She understands.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>Gowan, watching rigid and tense-lipped, with his
hand clenched on the hilt of his half-drawn Colt&#8217;s, was
astonished to see Mrs. Blake step forward and clasp
Isobel in her arms. But Ashton did not see the strange
act that checked the puncher&#8217;s vengeful shot. While
the girl was yet clinging to Blake, he had turned and
fled along the edge of the ravine, for the moment
stark mad with rage and despair.</p>
<p>He rushed off without a cry, and the others were
themselves far too surcharged with emotion to heed
his going until he had disappeared around a turn in
the ravine. When at last, almost spent with exertion,
he staggered up a ridge to glare back at those
from whom he had fled, his bloodshot eyes could perceive
only three figures on the brink of the gorge.
They were kneeling to look over into the ravine.</p>
<p>His thoughts were still in a wild whirl, but the heat
of his mad rage had passed and left him in a cold
fury. He instantly comprehended that Blake had
swung over the edge and was descending the rope down
the almost sheer face of the ravine wall.</p>
<p>Now was the time! A touch of a knife-edge to
the rope, and the girl would be saved. Would Gowan
think of it?... Of course he would think of it. But
he would not do it. He would leave the deed to be
done by the man to whom he had relinquished Miss
Chuckie. It was for that man to save her&ndash;&ndash;to destroy
the tempter and break the spell of fascination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
that was drawing her over the brink of a pit far deeper
than any earthly ca&ntilde;on. He, Lafayette Ashton&ndash;&ndash;not
Gowan&ndash;&ndash;was the man. He must save her&ndash;&ndash;down
there in the depths, where no eye could see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE DESCENT INTO HELL</h3>
</div>
<p>Dangling like a spider on its thread, with a
twist of the rope around one of his legs, Blake
had gone down into the ravine, hand under hand, with
the agility of a sailor. The tough leather of his
chapareras prevented the rope from chafing the leg
around which it slipped, and he managed with his free
foot to fend himself off from the sharp-cornered ledges
of the cliff side. In this he was less concerned for
himself than for his level, which he carried in a sling,
high up between his shoulders.</p>
<p>He was soon safe at the lower end of the rope, on
the shelf beside the bundled outfit. He waved his hat
to the down-peering watchers, and climbed a few yards
up the ravine, to creep in under an overhanging rock.
A few moments later the loosened rope came sliding
down the steep descent, the last length whipping from
ledge to ledge with a velocity that made it hiss through
the air.</p>
<p>Blake was not disturbed by this proof of the cumulative
speed of falling bodies. He came down and
coolly set about his preparations for the descent of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
gorge bottom. He unlashed the bundle and divided
its contents. This done, he took a vertical measurement
by going out towards the ca&ntilde;on along a horizontal
shelf on the side wall of the gorge, until he
could drop his surveying chain down the sheer precipice
to a shelf almost a hundred feet below him.</p>
<p>Unaware of Ashton&#8217;s mistake and furious flight, the
engineer was proceeding with his work in the expectation
that he would soon be joined by his assistant. He
was not disappointed. As he returned along the shelf,
after entering the measurement in his notebook, Ashton
came bounding and scrambling down the ravine
bottom at reckless speed. He fetched up on the verge
of the break, purple-faced and panting. His mouth
twitched nervously and there was a wild look in his
dark eyes. But Blake attributed all to the excitement
and exertion of the headlong rush down the ravine.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need for you to have hurried so, Lafe,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I suppose you had to go farther around than
I thought would be necessary. But I&#8217;d rather you had
kept me waiting an hour than for you to have chanced
spraining an ankle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you need me in your business!&#8221; scoffed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your employer&#8217;s business,&#8221; rejoined the engineer.
He straightened up from the packs that he was lashing
together and gazed gravely at his scowling assistant.
&#8220;See here, Mr. Ashton, this is no time for you to raise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
a row. We shall have quite enough else to think about
from now on, until we are up again out of the ca&ntilde;on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve enough to think about&ndash;&ndash;and more!&#8221; muttered
Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand? I&#8217;m not asking anything of you for
myself,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;You are doing this survey for
your employer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here because of <i>her</i>!&#8221; retorted the younger
man. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to make it certain that no harm is
to come to <i>her</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake smiled. &#8220;Good for you! I hardly thought
you were here for the fun of it. You are going to
prove to us that you have the makings. We&#8217;re both
working for her, Lafe. I don&#8217;t mind telling you now
that I am planning to do something big for her.&#8221; He
looked up the ravine wall, his eyes aglow with tenderness.
&#8220;Belle! dear little Belle! To think that after
all these years&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; cried Ashton. &#8220;Stop that! stop it,
and get to work! I know what you&#8217;re planning to
do! Don&#8217;t talk to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake stared in astonishment. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t think you
were so sore over that old affair. I told you I had
nothing to do about your father&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me! don&#8217;t talk to me!&#8221; frantically
cried Ashton. &#8220;You ruined me! Now her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! If you&#8217;re as sore as all that!&#8221; rejoined
Blake, his eyes hardening. &#8220;Look here, Mr. Ashton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
we&#8217;ll settle this when we get up on top again. Meantime,
I shall do my work, and I shall see to it that you
do yours. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get busy, then! I shall do <i>my</i> work!&#8221; snarled
Ashton.</p>
<p>Blake pointed to one of the three bundles that he
had tied together. &#8220;There&#8217;s half the grub, the tripod
and the rod. I can manage the rest. I&#8217;ve dropped
a measurement to the foot of the first incline.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung one of the other bundles on his back,
under the level. The third, which was made up of
railroad spikes and picket-pins, he sent rolling down
the steep slope, tied to one end of the rope. He had
driven a spike into a crevice of the rock. Hooking the
other end of the rope over its head with an open
loop, he grasped the line and started to walk down
the gorge bottom. As he descended he dragged the
loose lengths of rope after him.</p>
<p>Ashton stood rigid, staring at the spike and loop.
If the loop should slip or the spike pull out, he need
only climb back out of the ravine&ndash;&ndash;to her. But
Blake&#8217;s work was not the kind to slip or pull out. The
watcher looked at the powerful figure backing rapidly
down that roof-like pitch. One of the toes of the level
tripod under the taut loop would easily pry the rope
off the spike-head. He turned his pack around to get
at the tripod&ndash;&ndash;and paused to look upwards at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
three tiny faces peering down over the brink of the
cliff.</p>
<p>He slung the pack over his shoulder and grasped
the rope to follow his leader, who had come to the
narrow shelf from which another measurement must be
taken. He made the descent no less rapidly and easily
than had the engineer. He was naturally agile, and
now he was too full of his purpose to have any thought
of vertigo. Yet quickly as he followed, when he
reached the shelf he found that Blake had already lowered
the bundle of spikes over the cliff below and was
re&euml;nforcing with a spike a picket-pin that he had driven
deep into a crevice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop over the chain at that point,&#8221; curtly ordered
the engineer. &#8220;Think you can climb back up this slope
without the rope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ashton, still more curtly.</p>
<p>Blake lifted the line and sent up it a wave that
carried to the upper end and flipped the loop from the
spike-head. He jerked the freed end down to him
and knotted it securely to the picket-pin, while Ashton
was making the third vertical measurement. He then
lowered everything except the level in loops of the line,
and wrapped a strip of canvas around the line where
it bent over the sharp edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>Ashton laconically reported the measurement.
Blake noted it in his book, and promptly swung himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
out over the edge of the cliff. Again his assistant
looked at the fastening of the rope; again he looked
upwards at the three tiny down-peering faces; and again
he followed his leader. The sun was glaring directly
down into the gorge. Later they would descend into
the shadows where no eye could perceive from above
the loosening of the rope.</p>
<p>Blake cut off the line at the foot of the cliff and left
it dangling. They would require it for their ascent.
Another Titan step took fifty feet more of the rope.</p>
<p>There followed a series of steep pitches, which they
descended like the first, unlooping the rope from spike-head
after spike-head. The only real difficulty of this
part of the descent was the tedious task of carrying
the vertical measurement down the slopes at places
where even Blake could not find footing to climb out
horizontally on either wall of the gorge to obtain a
clear drop.</p>
<p>Always, as they descended, the engineer scanned
the rocks both above and below, calculating where the
gorge bottom could be reascended without a line.
Whenever he considered the incline too smooth or too
steep for safe footing, he drove in spikes near enough
together to be successively lassoed from below with a
length of line.</p>
<p>Had not the nature and condition of the rock provided
frequent faults and crevices that permitted the
driving of spikes, the descent must soon have become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
impracticable. But the engineer invariably found some
chink in which to hammer a spike with his powerful
blows. As, time after time, he overcame difficulties
so great that his companion could perceive no possible
solution, Ashton began to feel himself struggling
against a feeling of reluctant admiration.</p>
<p>All his hate could not blind him to the extraordinary
mental and physical efficiency displayed by the engineer.
Never once did the steely muscles permit a slip or
false step, never once did the cool brain miscalculate
the next most advantageous movement.</p>
<p>They were now so deep that Blake had to shout
his infrequent directions, to be heard above the booming
reverberations of the ca&ntilde;on. Half way down they
came to a forty-foot cliff. Blake made his preparations,
and swung over the edge. Here was an opportunity.
Ashton instantly bent over the knot of the
rope.</p>
<p>Close before his eyes he saw the clearly outlined
shadow of his head. He hesitated and straightened
on his knees to stare up at the top of the gorge. He
could no longer discern the three down-peering faces,
but he knew that they were still there. And the sunrays
still pierced down to him between the walls of
the gorge. The shadows were farther down, in the
lower depths. He must follow and wait.</p>
<p>When he slid to the foot of the cliff, Blake silently
cut off the rope. There was still nearly a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and fifty feet left for them to use below. But they
went down more than a thousand feet before they
again had need of it. As Blake had foretold, the
lower half of the descent was far less precipitous than
the upper. In places the vertical measurements were
carried down by rod readings, the level being set without
its tripod on the points of rock where the previous
readings had been taken. At other places Blake
marked out horizontal points ahead on the gorge wall,
and climbed to them with the chain.</p>
<p>All the time the reverberations of the ca&ntilde;on were
becoming louder. Dark shadows began to gather
along one wall of the gorge. The sun was no longer
directly in line with the ravine, and they were now far
down in the lower depths. Ashton&#8217;s knees were beginning
to tremble with weakness. They had brought
no water, for they were descending to the river. The
torment of thirst was added to the torment of his hate.
He began to look with fierce eagerness for the opportunity
to do his work&ndash;&ndash;to accomplish the deed for
which he had descended into this inferno. Then he
could go up again, out of the roaring, reverberating
hell about him, away from the burning hell within him.</p>
<p>The shadows were creeping out at him from the
side of the gorge. The sunshine was going&ndash;&ndash;it was
flickering away up the opposite precipices. Now it had
gone. All the gorge was somber with shadows. And
below were the blue-black depths of the ca&ntilde;on bottom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Dread crept in upon his smoldering hate to sweep
across its white-hot coals with chill gusts of fear.</p>
<p>But now they were come to another sheer cliff&ndash;&ndash;the
last in the descent. From its foot the gorge bottom
inclined easily down the final three hundred feet
to its mouth, where the river of the deep roared past
along the ca&ntilde;on bed, its foam flashing silvery white
through the gloom.</p>
<p>Here at last was the opportunity for which he had
waited&ndash;&ndash;here down in these dark shadows where no
eye could see&ndash;&ndash;here where no shriek or cry could
pierce up to the outer world of light and sunshine
through the wild uproar of the angry waters. He
awaited the moment, aflame with pent-up fury, shivering
with cold dread.</p>
<p>Blake dropped his chain from the cliff-edge and took
the last vertical measurement&ndash;&ndash;fifty-three feet. He
smiled. The hardest part of the work was almost accomplished.
He swung over the edge.</p>
<p>Ashton flung himself on his knees beside the triple
knot that held the line fast to its spike. This time
he did not hesitate, but began to tug at the rope end
with fierce eagerness. He loosened one knot. The
next was harder to unfasten. Blake had tied it with
utmost secureness. At last it yielded to the tugging
of his gloved fingers. He started to loosen the third
knot. Suddenly the taut line slackened. With a
stifled cry of rage, he paused to peer over the edge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Blake had slipped down the line so rapidly that he was
already at the foot of the cliff.</p>
<p>Reaching back, Ashton jerked the rope from the
spike-head, to cast it down on the engineer. A glimpse
of the flashing water in the ca&ntilde;on bottom gave momentary
check to his vengeful impulse. If only he had
a drink of that cool water! He was parched; his lips
were cracking; in his mouth was the taste of dust.
Must he stay up here on the dry rock while Blake went
on down beside the foaming river to drink his fill?</p>
<p>As he paused, a doubt clutched his heart in an icy
grip. All the way down that devil&#8217;s stairway he had
been witness to Blake&#8217;s extraordinary resourcefulness
and tremendous strength. What if he should find a
way to clamber up the precipices? He had lowered
everything before descending. There was nothing to
fling down upon him&ndash;&ndash;no loose rock or stone to topple
over and crush him.</p>
<p>Chilled by that doubt, Ashton hesitated, his hands
alternately tightening and relaxing their grip on the
rope. What if the man should contrive to escape?
There seemed no bounds to his ingenuity.... No,
he must be followed on down into the ca&ntilde;on and destroyed,
else he would escape&ndash;&ndash;he would come up
out of this inferno, like the demon he was, and destroy
<i>her</i>. He must be followed!... And the water&ndash;&ndash;the
cool, refreshing water!</p>
<p>His thirst now seized upon Ashton with terrible intensity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Rage, no less than the laborious exertion of
the descent, had dried up his body with its feverish
fire. Almost maddened with the torment of his craving,
he looped the rope on the spike-head with reckless
haste and slid down over the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>As the line tautened with his weight it gave several
inches, but he was too nearly frantic to heed. He
slipped down it so swiftly that the strands burned his
hands through the tough palms of his gloves. In a
few moments his feet were on a level with Blake&#8217;s
head. He clutched the rope tighter to check his fall.
An instant later he dropped heavily on the rock shelf
at the cliff foot, and the rope came swishing down after
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; shouted Blake. Involuntarily he flung
back his head and stared up the great gorge to the faraway
heights where were waiting his wife and child.</p>
<p>But Ashton neither paused nor looked upward. Rebounding
from his fall, he rushed down the slope to the
river, with a gasping cry&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Water! water!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a time the engineer stood as if stunned, his big
fists clenched, his broad chest heaving laboriously.
Yet he was far too well seasoned in desperate adventure
to give way to despair. Soon he rallied. He
lowered his gaze from the heights to examine the cliff
and the adjoining walls of the gorge. All were alike
sheer and unscalable. The lines about his big mouth
hardened with grim determination. He picked up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
rope and began winding it about his mid-body above
the low-buckled cartridge belt.</p>
<p>He arranged the coils with such care that he did
not notice the condition of the end of the line until
he had drawn in over eighty feet. Then at last he
saw. Though he had not forgotten to wrap the line
with canvas where it passed over the cliff edge, he had
thought the strands must have been frayed through on
a sharp corner of rock. Instead, he found himself
staring at the clean-cut string-wrapped rope end that
he had knotted to the spike.</p>
<p>For several moments he stood looking at it, his forehead
creased in thought. What had become of the
knot?... He could think of only one solution to
the puzzle. He turned and gazed down through the
gloom at the dim figure crouched beside the edge of
the swirling water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locoed,&#8221; he said pityingly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Locoed.... Poor
devil!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>IN THE GLOOM</h3>
</div>
<p>When the engineer came down to the river, Ashton
still crouched low, his dripping head close
over the water, as if he was afraid even to look away
from it. Blake rinsed out his mouth and stood up to
sip slowly from his hat, while looking about at the
awesome spectacle of the ca&ntilde;on bottom.</p>
<p>His first glance was at the swift-flowing stream. His
eyes brightened and the furrows in his forehead
smoothed away. The river was not as formidable as
its tumult and foam had threatened. It could be descended
by wading at the places where ledges and
bowlders along the base of the ca&ntilde;on walls failed to
afford safe footing. He glanced up the stupendous
precipices at the blue-black ribbon of sky, but only for
a moment. His present thought was not of escape
from the depths.</p>
<p>He bent over to grip the crouching man by the shoulder
and lift him to his feet. Ashton writhed about
and glared at him like a trapped wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;It was an accident! I
didn&#8217;t mean to do it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Blake, releasing his grip
but standing close that he might not have to shout.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, old man&ndash;&ndash;my fault. The knot
slipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You own it! You own it&#8217;s your fault!&#8221; cried
Ashton. &#8220;You&#8217;ve brought me down here into this
hell-pit! We can&#8217;t get out! Lost! All your fault&ndash;&ndash;yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a frantic snatch and jerked the revolver
from Blake&#8217;s holster. The engineer caught his wrist
in an iron grasp and wrenched the weapon from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that, old man,&#8221; he admonished with a
cool sternness that chilled the frenzy of the other like
a dash of ice water. &#8220;You&#8217;re here to do your work,
and you&#8217;re going to do it. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My work!&#8221; repeated Ashton wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, your work,&#8221; commanded Blake, his face as
hard as iron. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to survey Deep Ca&ntilde;on
down to the tunnel site. Your work is to carry rod.
Do you get that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down the ca&ntilde;on?&ndash;&ndash;deeper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get back up here. There&#8217;s a place down
there beyond the tunnel site where perhaps we can make
it up the ca&ntilde;on wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A place where we&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; shrilled Ashton. &#8220;A
place&ndash;&ndash;Good God! and you stand here doing nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>He whirled to spring out into the swirling water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Blake was still swifter in his movements. He caught
the fugitive by the arm and dragged him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;We must first carry
the levels down to the tunnel site. You hear that?
Stick by me, and I&#8217;ll pull you through. Try to run,
and, by God, I&#8217;ll shoot you like a dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive glared into the steel-white eyes of the
engineer, anger overcoming his panicky fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! I&#8217;ll do my
work&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll do my work!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll never get out of this ca&ntilde;on,&#8221;
grimly rejoined Blake. He released his hold, and
started up the slope, with a curt order: &#8220;Come along.
We can rod down the slope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton followed him, silent and morose. The instrument
was screwed to its tripod, and a line of levels
from the foot of the last vertical measurement was
carried down the slope to the ca&ntilde;on. The last rod
reading was on a ledge, three feet above the water,
at the corner of the gorge. Blake considered the reading
worthy of permanent record. They had measured
all the many hundreds of feet down from the top
of High Mesa to these profound depths. With his
two-pound hammer and one of the few remaining
spikes, he chiseled a cross deep in the surface of the
black rock.</p>
<p>That mark of the engineer-captain, scouting before
the van of man&#8217;s Nature-conquering army, was the sign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
of the first human beings that had ever descended alive
to the bottom of Deep Ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>When he had cut the cross, Blake took out his Colt&#8217;s,
and, gazing up the heights, began to fire at slow intervals.
Confined between the walls of gorge and
ca&ntilde;on, each report of the heavy revolver crashed out
above the tumult of the river and ran echoing and reechoing
up the stupendous precipices. Yet long before
they reached the rim of those towering walls they
blurred away and merged and were lost in the ceaseless
reverberations of the waters.</p>
<p>Blake well knew that this would happen. But he
also knew that the flash of the shot would be distinctly
discernible in the gloom of the abyss. As he fired, he
scanned the verge of the uppermost precipices. After
the fourth shot he ceased firing and flung up his hand
to point at the heights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;They see! There is the
flag!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared up with wide, feverish eyes. From
an out-jutting point of rock on the lofty rim he saw
a tiny white dot waving to and fro against the blue-black
sky. The watchers above had seen the flash of
the revolver shots and were fluttering the white flag
in responsive signal. Though on the world above the
sun beat down its full mid-afternoon flood of light,
the two men in the abyss could see stars twinkling in the
dark sky around the waving fleck of white.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>Blake fired two shots in quick succession, the agreed
signal that told the flag was seen. He then calmly
seated himself and began to add together the vertical
measurements taken during the descent of the gorge.
But Ashton groaned and flung himself face downward
on the rough stone.</p>
<p>Blake soon finished his sum in addition, and the result
brought a smile to his serious face. He checked
the figures with painstaking carefulness, and nodded,
fully satisfied. Replacing book and pencil in the deep
pocket of his shirt, he opened one of the packages of
food. When he had laid out enough for a hearty
meal, he looked at Ashton. The prostrate man had
not stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Lafe,&#8221; he called encouragingly. &#8220;Time to
eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton lay still and made no response.</p>
<p>Blake raised his voice&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Come! You&#8217;re not going
to quit. You&#8217;re going to eat. You must keep
your strength to fight your way through and up out of
here&ndash;&ndash;to <i>her</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton sullenly rose and came to sit down on the
rock beside the outspread food. He was silent, but
he ate even more heartily than his companion. When
they had finished, Blake swung his pack and level on
his shoulder, fired one shot, and stepped out into the
swift but shallow river. Wading as far downstream
as he could see to read the rod in the twilight of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
depths, he set up the tripod of his instrument on a
rock and took the reading given him by Ashton.</p>
<p>The survey of the ca&ntilde;on itself had begun. Unappalled
by the awful height of the mighty precipices on
either side, undaunted by the uncertainty of escape,
heedless of the gloom of the deep, of the tumult and
rush and chill of the icy waters, the engineer boldly
advanced to the attack of this abysmal stronghold of
Primeval Nature, his square jaw set in grim determination
to wrest from these hitherto inviolate depths
that which he sought to learn. Whatever might follow,
he must and would unlock the secret of the hidden
waters. Afterwards might come death by slow
starvation or the quick dashing down from some half-scaled
precipice. That mattered not now. First must
the engineer perform his work,&ndash;&ndash;first must he execute
the task that he had set himself for the conquest of the
chasm that was likely to prove his tomb.</p>
<p>Vastly different in purpose, yet no less resolute than
the engineer, Ashton joined zealously in the grim battle
with the abyss&ndash;&ndash;for battle it soon proved to be.
Only in places was the subterranean river shallow and
easy to wade. More often it foamed in wild fury
down steep rapids, to fling itself over ledges into black
pools; or, worst of all, it swirled deep and arrowy-swift
between fanged rocks where the channel narrowed.</p>
<p>Wading, swimming, leaping from rock to rock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
scrambling up and down the steep precipice foot, creeping
along narrow shelves,&ndash;&ndash;stubbornly the explorers
fought their way deeper through that wild passage.
Chilled by the icy waters and bruised by many a
slip on loose stones and wet, water-polished rocks, ever
they carried the line of levels down alongside the torrent,
crossing over and back from side to side, twisting
and turning with the twists and bends of the chasm.
And at every stand Blake jotted down the rod readings
in his half-soaked book with his pencil and figured
the elevation of each turning point before &#8220;pulling
up&#8221; his instrument to move on downstream to the next
&#8220;set up.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of every half hour he fired a single shot
to signal their progress in the depths to the watchers
above. But never once did he stop to look up for the
flag. Occasionally he was required to help Ashton
through or over some unusually difficult passage. For
the most part, however, each fought his own way.
The odds were not altogether in favor of the older
man. He was hampered by the care of the instrument,
which must be shielded from all blows or falls. The
rod, on the contrary, served as a staff and support to
Ashton, alike in the water and on the rocks.</p>
<p>Some time before sunset the waning light in the
ca&ntilde;on bottom became so dim that Blake was compelled
to cease work. He took a last reading on a broad
shelf of rock well above the surface of the water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
joined Ashton on the shelf, and began firing the revolver
at five-minute intervals. After the fifth shot he
at last perceived the white dot of the flag far above
on the opposite brink of the chasm. He fired two
shots in quick succession, and calmly sat down to open
one of the soaked packages of food.</p>
<p>Ashton did not wait to be bidden to supper. He
fell to on the food and ate ravenously. Blake did not
check him, though he himself took little and carefully
gathered up and returned to the package every scrap
of food left at the end of the meal. As Ashton lay
back on the rock he squirmed from side to side and
groaned. His bruises were so numerous that he could
not find a comfortable position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up!&#8221; grimly quoted Blake. &#8220;The worst is
yet to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stretched himself out on the rock-shelf and, regardless
of the sullen resistance of the younger man,
drew him into his arms. Chilled to the marrow by his
frequent icy drenchings, Ashton was shivering in the
cold wind which came down the ca&ntilde;on with the approach
of night. But Blake&#8217;s massive body and limbs
were aglow with abundant vitality. Warmed and
sheltered from the wind, the exhausted man relaxed
like a child in the strong arms of his companion and
quickly sank into the deep slumber of overtaxed nature.</p>
<p>Blake lay awake until the narrow strip of sky that
showed between the vast walls of rock deepened to an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
inky blackness thickly sprinkled with scintillating stars.
The light of a watchfire flamed red far above on the
opposite rim of the chasm wall. To the man below
it was like the glow of human love in the chill darkness
of the Unknown. With a gesture of reverent
passion and adoration, he put his fingers to his lips and
flung a kiss up out of the abyss. Then he, too, relaxed
on the hard rock and sank into heavy sleep.</p>
<p>Ashton was the first to waken. The wind had
changed, and he was roused by the different note in the
ceaseless roar of the river. He stared up at the star-jeweled
sky. It was still intensely black; yet the gloom
of the depths was lessened by a vague pale illumination,
a faint shadow of light that might have been the
ghost of a dead day. He thought it was the gray
dawn, and sought to roll over on his rock bed away
from the sheltering embrace of Blake. The engineer
was still deep in profound slumber. His big arm
slipped laxly from across the moving man&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>The change of position wrung a groan from Ashton.
Every muscle in his body was cramped, every bruise
stiff and sore. Not until he had turned and twisted
for several moments was he able to rise to his feet.
The vague ghost light about him brightened. He
gazed upwards. He did not notice the tiny flame of
the fire that told of the anxious watchers above. Out
over the monstrous black wall of the abyss was drifting
a burnished silver-white disk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The moon!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;Only the moon!
To wait here&ndash;&ndash;with him!&ndash;&ndash;with him!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at the big form of the sleeping man,
and suddenly all his pent-up rage burst its bounds. It
poured through his veins in streams of fire. He stared
about in fierce eagerness in search of a weapon. Blake
lay upon the hilt of the revolver; the level rod lacked
weight and balance. But the heavy hammer&ndash;&ndash;a blow
on the upturned temple of the sleeper!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>With the cunning stealth of madness, Ashton took
up the hammer and crept around back of Blake&#8217;s head.
He straightened on his knees, and peered down at the
calm, powerful face of the engineer.</p>
<p>What if he was a veritable Samson, this conqueror
of ca&ntilde;ons? Where now was his power? Sleep had
bound fast his steel muscles, had numbed his indomitable
will and locked his keen intellect in the black
prison of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>The avenger hovered over him, gloating. Now at
last was come the opportunity&ndash;&ndash;the perfect opportunity,
down in these uttermost depths, in the secret night
time. The world above slept&ndash;&ndash;and he slept. Never
should he waken from that sleep; never should he
rouse up in his evil strength to escape out of the abyss
and bring ruin to her!</p>
<p>Lightly the hammer swung over and downward,
measuring the curve of the stroke. It lifted and
poised. Again it swung down; and again it lifted and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
poised. The blow must be certain&ndash;&ndash;there must not
be the slightest chance of missing.</p>
<p>Each time the heavy steel head stopped a full two
inches short of the upturned temple&ndash;&ndash;but each time
its shadow fell across the eyes of the sleeper. He
stirred. The hammer whirled up, gripped in both
hands of the kneeling man. The sleeper turned flat
on his back, with his face full to the light. A quiver
ran through the tense muscles of the avenger. Had
the eyes of the sleeper opened, had their lids so much
as fluttered, the hammer must have crashed down.</p>
<p>But it was the sleeper&#8217;s lips that moved. As it were
by a miracle of acuteness, the tense nerves of the
other&#8217;s ear caught the whispered words through the
roaring of the river&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>Jenny! Son!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The hammer hurled away out into the swirl of the
foam-flecked waters. The avenger flung himself
about, face downward on the rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; he sobbed, in an agony of remorse.
&#8220;Forgive me, God! I cannot do it! I am weak&ndash;&ndash;unfit!...
Not even to save her!&ndash;&ndash;not even to save
her!&#8221;</p>
<p>He writhed in the anguish of his love and rage and
self-abasement. He had failed; he was too weak to do
the deed. But God&ndash;&ndash;Would God permit that evil
should befall her?</p>
<p>He struggled to his feet and flung up his quivering
hands to moon and stars and black sky in passionate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
invocation&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;O God! You say that vengeance is
Yours; that You will repay! Take me, if You will&ndash;&ndash;I
give myself! Only destroy him too! Save her!
save her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Blake stirred, and this time he opened his eyes.
Ashton had sunk down in a huddled silent heap.
Blake gazed up at the watchfire on the heights, smiled,
and turned over to again fall asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>LOWER DEPTHS</h3>
</div>
<p>Beetling precipices shut off the direct light of
the moonbeams and left the abyss again in dense
darkness long before the coming of the laggard dawn.
Blake slept on, storing up strength for the renewal of
the battle. Yet even he could not outsleep the reluctant
lingering of night. He awoke while the tiny
flame of the watchfire still flickered bright against the
inky darkness of the sky.</p>
<p>Ashton had fallen into a fitful doze. The engineer
stood up and silently groped his way to and fro on the
shelf of rock, stretching and limbering his cramped
muscles. He wasted no particle of energy; the moment
he had relieved his stiffness he stretched out again.
He lay contemplating that flame of love on the heights
until it faded against the lessening blackness of the sky
and the rays of the morning sun began to angle down
the upper precipices.</p>
<p>He rose to take out two portions of food from the
single pack in which he had bound up all the provisions.
The portion for Ashton was small; his own was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
smaller. He roused the dozing man and placed the
larger share of food in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drop it,&#8221; he cautioned. &#8220;That&#8217;s all I can
let you have. We must go on rations until we can see
a way out of this hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton ate his meager breakfast without replying.
The fire within him had burned to ashes. He was cold
and dull and dispirited. He had failed. He would
have been willing to sit and brood, and wait for God
to answer his prayer.&ndash;&ndash;But his waiting was not to be
an inert lingering in the place where he had failed.</p>
<p>The moment the down-creeping daylight so lessened
the gloom of the depths that Blake could take rod readings,
he plunged over into the stream, with a curtly
cheerful command for Ashton to prepare to follow.
Too dejected even to resist, the younger man silently
obeyed. When Blake signaled to him through the
dimness, he held the rod on the last turning-point of
the previous day, and lowered himself from the shelf
down into the stream.</p>
<p>The evening before, the water at this point had come
up to his waist. It was now only knee-deep. His
surprise was so great that in passing Blake he broke
his sullen silence to remark the fact and ask what could
have caused the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melting of the snow on the high range,&#8221; the engineer
shouted in explanation. &#8220;Takes time for it to
run down the ca&ntilde;on all these miles. River probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
still falling. Will begin to rise about noon. Faster
we get along now, the easier it will be. Hustle!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton responded mechanically to the will of his
commander. For the time being his own will was almost
paralyzed. The reaction from his long-sustained
rage had left him dazed and nerveless. He had sunk
into a state of fatalistic indifference. He moved
quickly downstream from turning-point to turning-point,
driven by Blake&#8217;s will, but with a heedless recklessness
that all Blake&#8217;s warnings could not check.</p>
<p>Within the first hour he twice stumbled and went
under while wading deep reaches of the river, and once
he fell from a ledge, bruising himself severely and
knocking a splinter from the rod. Half an hour later
he lost his footing in descending a swift and narrow
place that would have been impassable at high water.
Had not Blake been below him he would never have
come out alive.</p>
<p>The engineer leaped in and dragged the drowning
man to safety, after a desperate struggle with the torrent.
But in the wild swirl, both the food-pack and
the rod went adrift. The moment he had rescued his
companion, Blake rushed away downstream, leaping
like a goat from rock to rock. He at last overtook
the rod, caught in the eddy of a pool. Of the pack he
could find no trace. He returned to Ashton and silently
handed him the rod.</p>
<p>There was no need for him to admonish. The loss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
of all the food and the narrowness of his escape had
sobered the younger man. He resumed his work with
a cautious swiftness of movement that avoided all
needless risks yet never hesitated to encounter and rush
through the dangers that could not be avoided. In
this he copied Blake.</p>
<p>All the time they were advancing down the angry
torrent, deeper and deeper into its secret stronghold,&ndash;&ndash;creeping,
crawling, leaping, wading, swimming&ndash;&ndash;step
by step, turn after turn, wresting from the abyss that
which the engineer was resolved to learn, even though
he should learn, only to perish.</p>
<p>The day advanced. Steadfastly they struggled on
down the bed of the river, twisting and crossing over
with the winding course of the chasm; now between
beetling precipices that shut out all sight of the blue-black
sky; now in more open stretches where the Titanic
walls swung apart and the glorious hot sun rays
pierced down into the very depths to warm their
drenched bodies and lighten their heavy spirits.</p>
<p>Ashton had long since lost all count of time. His
watch had been smashed in his first fall of the day.
But Blake seemed to have an intuitive sense of time.
At fairly regular intervals he fired a shot to tell the
watchers above the extent of their progress. Sometimes
the answering flag-signal could be seen waving
from the rim of the ca&ntilde;on. But in many places those
above could not come near the brink to look over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>The approach of midday found the bruised and
weary fighters struggling through one of the narrowest
reaches of the ca&ntilde;on. The precipices jutted out so far
that the lower depths seemed more cavern than chasm,
and the river swirled deep and swift between sheer,
narrow walls. Twice Ashton was swept past what
should have been the next turning-point, and Blake, unable
to see the figures on the rod, had to guess at his
readings.</p>
<p>At last the precipices swung apart and showed the
sky at a twist in the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s course that was the sharpest
of all the turns the explorers had as yet encountered.
As Blake came wading down past Ashton, along the
inner curve of the bend, he stopped and pointed skywards.
Ashton raised his drooping head and peered
up at the rim of the opposite wall. From the brink a
dense column of green-wood smoke was rising into the
indigo sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;One more set-up,&#8221; shouted Blake.</p>
<p>Three minutes later he took a reading on the water
and on a point of rock at the angle of the ca&ntilde;on-side
around which the river swung in its sharp curve.
Three more minutes, and the two battered fighters
stood together on the last bench of that tremendous
line of levels, with torn and rent clothing, sodden, gaping
boots, bodies bruised from head to foot&ndash;&ndash;bleeding,
weary, but victorious! They had finished the
work that Blake had set out to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>He held up the now-soaked notebook for Ashton to
see the last penciled elevation on the wet paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand, forty-five!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Over
five hundred feet above that bench in Dry Greek Gulch!
Water, electricity!&ndash;&ndash;Dry Mesa shall be a garden!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stared moodily into the exultant face of the
engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of that?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;How do you
know that God will let you climb up out of this hell of
stone and water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the saying, &#8216;God helps those who help
themselves,&#8217;&#8221; replied Blake. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put up
the best fight I can. If that doesn&#8217;t win out, I shall
at least have the satisfaction of not having quit. If
you wish to pray, do so. The sooner we start the better.
From now on, the water will be rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I prayed last night,&#8221; said Ashton. He added
somberly, &#8220;And now we are both going to the
devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Blake, with no less earnestness.
&#8220;There is no devil&ndash;&ndash;there is no room for a devil in
all the universe. What man calls evil is ignorance,&ndash;&ndash;his
ignorance of those primeval forces of nature which
he has yet to chain; his ignorance of those higher qualities
in his own nature which, if known, would prevent
him from wronging others and would enable him to
bring happiness to himself and others.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You say that!&#8221; cried Ashton. &#8220;You can mock!
You do not believe in hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake smiled grimly. &#8220;What do you call this?&ndash;&ndash;But
you mean a hell hereafter. I believe this: If,
when we pass into the Unknown, we continue to exist
as individual consciousnesses, then we carry with us
the heaven and the hell that we have each upbuilt for
ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God will not let you escape,&#8221; stated Ashton.
&#8220;You will pass from this hell of water into the hell of
fire and brimstone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have it your own way,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I lived
one summer in Death Valley. The other place can&#8217;t
be much hotter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He climbed up the ledges and planted the level firmly
on its tripod above the high-water mark of the spring
floods. He called down to Ashton: &#8220;Hate to leave
the old monkey up here; but it will serve as a memento
of our present visit, when we come down again to locate
the tunnel head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can it be that we shall ever come down
again?&#8221; replied Ashton. &#8220;It is impossible&ndash;&ndash;for we
shall never go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake jumped down the ledges to him and pointed
to the column of smoke on the lofty heights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is where we are going,
if there is any possible way to go. An optimist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
would stand here and wait, certain that wings would
soon sprout for him to fly up; a pessimist would sit
down and quit. An optimist is a fool; a pessimist is a
worse fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And which are you?&#8221; asked Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am neither. I am a meliorist. I am going to
face the facts, and then fight for all I&#8217;m worth.
What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;re going to do the same. Come!
We&#8217;ve still got some clothes left, the rod for you to
use as a staff, this rope, the revolver, and seventeen
cartridges. It&#8217;s fortunate we have any. We&#8217;ve got
to signal that we are going on down the ca&ntilde;on, instead
of back up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well stay and die here. But since you
prefer to keep moving, I have no objections,&#8221; said Ashton,
with ironical politeness.</p>
<p>Blake promptly stepped into the water and led the
way to the next shelf of rock. Here he fired a shot.
Going a few yards farther along the rocks, he fired
again. Three times he fired, at intervals of two minutes.
Then the white dot of the flag appeared on the
precipice brink directly up across from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more, and we&#8217;re sure they understand,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Advancing a full hundred yards on down the ca&ntilde;on,
he fired the fourth shot. Very soon the fleck of white
flaunted on the rim a little way beyond them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They understand!&#8221; cried Blake. &#8220;Trust Jenny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
to use her head! Now catch your breath and tighten
up. We&#8217;re going to move!&#8221;</p>
<p>He started, and Ashton followed close behind. It
was the same rough, fierce game of leaping, crawling,
wading, swimming,&ndash;&ndash;battling with the river, the rocks,
the ledges. But now they were no longer checked and
halted by the alternate stoppings for set-ups and turning-points,
and no longer was Blake encumbered with
the care of the level. There was nothing now to
hinder or delay them except the natural obstacles of
their wild path down the bed of the torrent.</p>
<p>Blake could give all his thought to picking the best
and quickest way through rapids and falls, over the
water-washed rocks and along the side ledges. And
he could give all his great strength to helping his companion
past the hard places. In return Ashton gave
such help as he could to the engineer, many times when
a steadying hand or the outstretched rod rendered
easier a descent or the fording of some swift mill race
in the stream.</p>
<p>At the end of the first quarter-mile Blake had fired
a shot, and again at the second quarter. After that
he waited longer intervals. He considered it advisable
to husband the few remaining cartridges.</p>
<p>The river was now rapidly rising. But every inch
of added depth found the two fugitives much farther
down the ca&ntilde;on. In two hours they advanced thrice
the distance that they had covered in the same time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
before noon, and this despite the increasing depth and
force of the river.</p>
<p>The pace was so hot that Ashton was beginning to
stumble and slip, but Blake kept by him and helped him
along by word and deed. He asserted and repeated a
dozen times over, that they were nearing the place
where an ascent of the precipices might be possible.
At last they rounded a turn in the winding chasm, and
Blake was able to point to a break in the sheer wall on
the Dry Mesa side, where the precipices were set back
one above the other in a Cyclopean stepladder and
their steeply-pitched faces were rough with crevices and
shelves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s the place&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
our ladder up from hell to heaven!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton soon lowered his weary head. He stared
dully downstream to where a fifty-foot cliff extended
across from side to side of the ca&ntilde;on like a dam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the wall slid in,&#8221; he stated with the simplicity
of one who is nearing exhaustion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That shall be our bridge to the ladder,&#8221; shouted
Blake. &#8220;It&#8217;s all sheer cliff along here at the foot of
the break, but the ledges run down sideways to the top
of the cross cliff. We shall soon be lying up there,
high and dry, getting our second wind for the run up
the ladder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engineer spoke confidently, and felt what he
spoke. But as they struggled on down the turbulent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
stream to the cross cliff, the light left his face. From
wall to wall of the ca&ntilde;on the great mass of fallen rock
stretched across the bottom in a sheer-faced barrier,
broken only by a tunnel barely large enough to suck in
the swelling volume of the river.</p>
<p>Blake came down close to the intake, scanning every
foot of the cliff face for a scalable break or crevice.
There was none to be found. He climbed along the
cliff foot to a low shelf beside the roaring tunnel, and
stood staring at the opening in deep thought. Even
while he looked, the swelling volume of the river filled
the tunnel to its roof. Blake peered at the fresh watermark
twenty feet up the face of the cliff, and bent down
beside Ashton, who had stretched out to rest on the
shelf of rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing to it, old man,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We must dive through that tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through that hole?&#8221; gasped Ashton. &#8220;No!
I&#8217;ve done enough. I shall stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To drown like a rat in a rainwater barrel!&#8221; rejoined
Blake. &#8220;Look at that watermark. The tunnel
is now running full. Inside a quarter-hour the
river will be up over this ledge. It will keep rising
till it reaches that mark, and it will not fall until after
low water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I care?&#8221; said Ashton hopelessly. &#8220;Go
to the devil your own way. I&#8217;d rather drown here
than in that underground hole. Leave me alone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>Blake considered a full half minute, looked up the
cliff face, and replied: &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s as well. I shall
do the best I can. But first I want to tell you I&#8217;ve
wiped out all that past affair. You are another person
from that Lafayette Ashton. We stand here almost
face to face with the Unknown. One or both of us
may soon go out into the Darkness. As we may never
meet again, I wish to tell you that you have proved
yourself, even more than I hoped when I saw you come
rushing down the ravine to join me. You have proved
yourself a man. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand. But Ashton turned his face
to the wall of rock and was silent. After a time he
heard the sound of Blake&#8217;s worn heels on the outer
end of the shelf. His ears, attuned to the ceaseless
tumult of the waters, caught the click of the protruded
heel-nail heads. There was a brief pause&ndash;&ndash;then the
plunge. He looked about quickly and saw Blake&#8217;s hands
vanish in the down-sucking eddy where the swollen
waters drew into the now hidden intake of the tunnel.</p>
<p>A cry of horror burst from his heaving chest.
Blake had gone&ndash;&ndash;Blake the iron-limbed, iron-hearted
man. He had conquered the river&ndash;&ndash;and now the
wild waters had seized him and were mauling and
smashing and crushing him in the terrible mill of the
cavern. Beyond that underground passage, it might
be miles away, the victor would fling up on some fanged
rock a shapeless mass that once had been a man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Ashton again turned his face to the rock and
groaned. God had answered his prayer. Now
must he pay the price. If only he could force himself
to lie still while the rising waters brimmed up over the
ledge and up over his head and face. He was tired&ndash;&ndash;tired!
It would be so peaceful to lie and rest under
the quiet waters.</p>
<p>But the first ripple that crept over the surface of the
shelf brought him to his feet with the chill of its icy
touch. He climbed to a shelf higher up and again
stretched himself full length on the rock. To lie still
and rest was heavenly.... It was too good to last.
The water crept after him up the ledge. This time he
could climb no higher.</p>
<p>He sat erect and waited, still resting, until the flood
rose to his chin. Then he stood up, leaning on the
battered level rod. The water rose after him, creeping
with relentless stealth from his thigh to his waist,
from his waist to his chest. It would soon be lapping
at his throat, and then&ndash;&ndash;he must begin to swim.
Life was far stronger within him than he had thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
His strength had come back. Blake was right. A
man should fight. He should hold fast to hope, and
fight to the very last.</p>
<p>Something swept from side to side along the face
of the cliff above him. It tapped the rock close over
his head. He looked up and saw a rope. He could
not see over the rounded brink of the cliff, but he had
no need. There was a rescuer above him who knew
his desperate situation. Could it be Blake? Surely
not! He must have perished in the frightful vortex
of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The rope swung lower. Now it was within reach.
Ashton made a clutch as it swept over him and caught
its end. He gave a tug. At once the line slackened
down to him. He felt something in his palm, twisted
between the rope strands. He looked and saw that it
was a piece of folded paper. He opened it and found
written a terse sentence in Blake&#8217;s bold clear hand:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
Tie rod to line and climb.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Why should he tie the splintered level rod to the
rope? Of what possible use could it be in climbing the
precipices? But even while Ashton asked himself
the questions he obeyed Blake&#8217;s directions. The water
lapped up over his chin as he tied the knot. He pulled
heavily on the rope. It gave a little way, and then
tautened. He reached up and began to climb, hand
over hand, with desperate speed.</p>
<div class='figtag'>

<div class='figcenter'>

Another desperate clutch at the rope&ndash;&ndash;still another<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>Thirty feet above the water his strength was almost
outspent, but he struggled to raise himself one more
time, and then another. To pause meant to slip back
and perish. Another upward heave. The rope here
bent in over the rounding cliff. Hardly could he force
his fingers between it and the rock. Yet if only he
could get his knee up on the sharp slope! He heaved
again, his face purple with exertion, the veins swelling
out on his forehead as if about to burst.</p>
<p>At last! his knee was up and braced against the
rock. Another desperate clutch at the rope&ndash;&ndash;another
heave&ndash;&ndash;still another. The cliff edge was rounding
back. Every upward hitch was easier than the one before.
Now he was scrambling up on toes and knees;
now he could rise to his feet.</p>
<p>The line led across a waterworn ledge and downward.
Ashton peered over, and saw the senseless
body of Blake wedged against the other side of the
ledge. About it, close below the arms, the line was
knotted fast.</p>
<p>Ashton stared wonderingly at the still, white face
of the unconscious man. It was covered with cold
sweat. A peculiar twist in the sprawling left leg
caught his attention. He looked&ndash;&ndash;and understood.
Panting with exertion, he staggered down the ledges of
the lower side of the barrier to where the river burst
furiously out of the mouth of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Hurled by that mad torrent from the darkness of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
gorged cavern straight upon a line of rocks, all Blake&#8217;s
strength and quickness had not enabled him to save
himself from injury. Yet he had crept up those rough
ledges, dragging his shattered leg. Atrocious as must
have been his agony, he had crept all the way to the
top, had written the note, and flung down the rope to
rescue his companion.</p>
<p>There was no vessel in which Ashton could carry
water. He had no hat, his boots were full of holes,
he must use his hands in scrambling back up the ledges.
He stripped off his tattered flannel shirt, dipped it in
a swirling eddy, and started back as fast as he could
climb.</p>
<p>Blake still lay unconscious. Ashton straightened
out the twisted leg, and knelt to bathe the big white
face with an end of the dripping garment. After a
time the eyelids of the prostrate man fluttered and
lifted, and the pale blue eyes stared upward with returning
consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here!&#8221; cried Ashton. &#8220;Do you see? You
saved me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colt&#8217;s gone,&#8221; muttered Blake. &#8220;But cartridges&ndash;&ndash;fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, fire the cartridges to let them know
where we are? How can I do it without the revolver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, build a fire,&#8221; replied the engineer. He raised
a heavy hand to point towards the high end of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
barrier. &#8220;Driftwood up there. Bring it down.
I&#8217;ll light it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Light it&ndash;&ndash;how?&#8221; asked Ashton incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it,&#8221; ordered Blake.</p>
<p>Ashton hurried across the crest of the barrier to
where it sloped up and merged in the precipice foot.
The mass of rock that formed the barrier had fallen
out of the face of the lower part of the ca&ntilde;on wall,
leaving a great hollow in the rock. But above the hollow
the upper precipices beetled out and rose sheer, on
up the dizzy heights to the verge of the chasm. Contrasted
with this awesome undermined wall, the
broken, steeple-sloped precipices adjoining it on the
upstream side looked hopefully scalable to Ashton.
He marked out a line of shelves and crevices running
far up to where the full sunlight smiled on the rock.</p>
<p>But Blake had told him to fetch wood for a fire, that
they might signal the watchers on the heights. He
hastened up over the rocks to the heaps of logs and
branches stranded on the high end of the barrier by the
freshets. Every year the river, swollen by the spring
rains, brimmed over the top of this natural dam.</p>
<p>Yet not all the heaps lying on the ledges were driftwood.
As Ashton approached, he was horrified to see
that the largest and highest situated piles were nothing
else than masses of bones. Drawn by a gruesome
fascination, he climbed up to the nearest of the ghastly
heaps. The loose ribs and vertebr&aelig; scattered down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
the slope seemed to him the size of human ribs and
vertebr&aelig;. He shuddered as they crunched under his
tread.</p>
<p>Then he saw a skull with spiral-curved horns. He
looked up the ca&ntilde;on wall, and understood. The high-heaped
bones were the skeletons of sheep. In a flash,
he remembered Isobel&#8217;s account of Gowan, that first
day up there on the top of the mesa. Not only had
the puncher killed six men; he had, together with other
violent men of the cattle ranges, driven thousands of
sheep over into the ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;and this was the place.</p>
<p>Sick with horror and loathing, Ashton ran to snatch
up an armful of the smaller driftwood and hurry back
down to the center of the barrier. He found Blake
lying white and still. But beside him were three
cartridges from which the bullets had been worked out.
At the terse command of the engineer, Ashton ground
one of the older and drier pieces of wood to minute
fragments on a rock.</p>
<p>Blake emptied the powder from one of the cartridges
into the little pile of splinters, and holding the
edge of another shell against a corner of the rock,
tapped the cap with a stone. At the fifth stroke the
cap exploded. The loosened powder of the cartridge
flared out into the powder-sprinkled tinder. Soon a
fire of the dry, half-rotted driftwood was blazing
bright and almost smokeless in the twilight of the
depths.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now haul up the rod,&#8221; directed Blake, and he lay
back to bask in the grateful warmth.</p>
<p>Ashton drew up the level rod and came back over the
ledge. He found that the engineer had freed himself
from the last coils of the rope and was unraveling the
end that had been next his body. But his eyes were
upturned to the heights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look&ndash;&ndash;the flag!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already?&#8221; exclaimed Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. No doubt one of them has been waiting
on that out-jutting point.&ndash;&ndash;Now, if you&#8217;ll break the
rod. We&#8217;ve got to get my leg into splints.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crude splints were soon ready. For bandages
there were strips from the tattered shirts of both men.
Unraveled rope-strands, burnt off in the fire, served to
lash all together. Beads of cold sweat gathered and
rolled down Blake&#8217;s white face throughout the cruel
operation. Yet he endured every twist and pull of
the broken limb without a groan. When at last the
bones were set to his satisfaction and the leg lashed
rigid to the splints, he even mustered a faint smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;That beats an amputation,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Now
if you can help me up under the cliff, where you can
plant the fire against a back-log&ndash;&ndash;I want to dry out
and do some planning while you&#8217;re climbing up for
help. I&#8217;ve an idea we can put in a dynamo down
here, with turbines in the intake and in the mouth of
the tunnel&ndash;&ndash;carry a wire up over the top of the mesa
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
and down into the gulch. Understand? All the
electric power we want to drive the tunnel, and very
cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; gasped Ashton. &#8220;You can lie here&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;maimed,
already starving&ndash;&ndash;and can plan
like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? No fun thinking of my leg, is it? As
for the rest, you&#8217;re going up to report the situation.
They&#8217;ll soon manage to yank me out of this blessed
hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;But that&#8217;s the question,&#8221;
he rejoined. &#8220;Am I going to go up? Am I
going to try to go up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake looked at him with a steady, unflinching gaze.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer about all this. Isn&#8217;t it
time you explained? When the rope came off that last
cliff in the gorge and I saw that you had untied it before
sliding down, I thought you were off your head.
And two or three times today, too. But since we
landed here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your broken leg,&#8221; interrupted Ashton&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;it made
me forget. You had saved me with the rope. I had
to help you. Now I see how foolish I have been. I
should have left you to lie here, and flung myself back
over into the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; calmly queried Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! You ask why?&#8221; cried Ashton, his eyes
ablaze with excitement, his whole body quivering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see? Are you blind? What do I care
about myself if I can save her from you? I shall not
try to escape. You shall never go up there to work
her harm!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harm her? You mean put through this irrigation
project?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; shouted Ashton. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lie and pretend,
you hypocrite! You know what I mean! You know
she could not hide how you were enticing her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake stared in utter astonishment. Then, regardless
of his leg, he sat up and said quietly: &#8220;I see. I
thought you must have understood when she told me,
there at the last moment before we started. She is my
sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister!&#8221; scoffed Ashton. &#8220;You liar! You have
no sister. Your sisters died years ago. Genevieve
told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what I told her. I believed it true.
But it was not true. Belle did not die&ndash;&ndash;God! when
I think of that! It has helped me through this fight&ndash;&ndash;it
helped me crawl up here with that leg dangling.
Good God! To think of Jenny waiting for me up
there, and Son, and little Belle too&ndash;&ndash;little Belle whom
all these years I thought dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton stood as if turned to stone. &#8220;Belle&ndash;&ndash;you
call her Belle? She told me&ndash;&ndash;Chuckie only a
nickname!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Adopted&ndash;&ndash;her real
name Isobel!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We always called her Belle&ndash;&ndash;Baby Belle! She
was the youngest,&#8221; said Blake.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why&ndash;&ndash;why did you not&ndash;&ndash;tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know. She did&ndash;&ndash;she knew from the
first, there at Stockchute. I see it now. Even before
that, she must have guessed it. Yes, I see all now.
She sent for me to come out here, because she thought
I might be her brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not tell me!&#8221; reproached Ashton, his face
ghastly. &#8220;How was I to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, I did not know,&#8221; repeated Blake. &#8220;At
first&ndash;&ndash;yes, all along&ndash;&ndash;there was something about her
voice and face&ndash;&ndash;But she had changed so much, and
all these years&ndash;&ndash;eight, nine years&ndash;&ndash;I had thought
her dead. She gave me no sign&ndash;&ndash;only that friendliness.
I did not know until the very last moment, there
on the edge of the ravine. I thought you saw it; that
you heard her tell me. It seemed to me everybody
must have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was running away&ndash;&ndash;I could not bear it. I
think I must have been crazy for a time. If only I had
heard! My God! if only I had heard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know now,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;What&#8217;s
done is done. The question now is, what are you going
to do next?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly Ashton&#8217;s drooping figure was a-quiver with
eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish first to be taken up near the driftwood,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
he exclaimed. &#8220;Let me lift you. Don&#8217;t be afraid to
put your weight on me. Hurry! We must lose no
time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake was already struggling up. Ashton strained
to help him rise erect on his sound leg. Braced and
half lifted by the younger man, the engineer hobbled
and hopped along the barrier crest and up its sloping
side. His trained eye picked out a great weather-seasoned
pine log lying directly beneath the outermost
point of the ca&ntilde;on rim. An object dropped over
where the flag still flecked against the indigo sky, would
have fallen straight down to the log, unless deflected
by the prong of a ledge that jutted out twelve hundred
feet from the top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; panted Blake, regardless of the great pile
of skeletons heaped on the far end of the log. &#8220;This
place&ndash;&ndash;right below them! Go back&ndash;&ndash;bring fire and
rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton ran back to fetch the rope and a dozen blazing
sticks. Driftwood was strewn all around. In a
minute he had a fire started against the butt end of the
log. He began to gather a pile of fuel. But Blake
checked him with a cheerful&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, old
man. I can manage now. Take the rope, and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Ashton had coiled the rope over his shoulder
and under the opposite arm, he came and stood before
his prostrate companion. His face was scarlet with
shame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a fool&ndash;&ndash;and worse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
doubted her. I am utterly unfit to live. If I were
alone down here, I would stay and rot. But you are
her brother. If it is possible to get up there, I am
going up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going up!&#8221; encouraged Blake. &#8220;You
will make it. Give my love to them. Tell them I&#8217;m
doing fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ashton. &#8220;I&#8217;d give anything if I could
grip hands with you. But I cannot. You are her
brother. I am unfit to touch your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and ran up the precipice-foot to the first
steep ascent of the steeple-sloped break in the wall of
the abyss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE CLIMBER</h3>
</div>
<p>A day of anxiety, only partly relieved by those
tiny flashes of light so far, far down in the awful
depths; then the long night of ceaseless watching.
Neither Genevieve nor Isobel had been able to sleep
during those hours when no flash signaled up to them
from the abysmal darkness.</p>
<p>Then at last, a full hour after dawn on the mesa
top, the down-peering wife had caught the flash that
told of the renewal of the exploration. As throughout
the previous day, Gowan brought the ladies food
and whatever else they needed. Only the needs of the
baby had power to draw its mother away from the
ca&ntilde;on edge. Isobel moved always along the giddy
verge wherever she could cling to it, following the unseen
workers in the depths.</p>
<p>On his first trip to the ranch, the puncher had
brought Genevieve&#8217;s field glasses&ndash;&ndash;an absurdly small
instrument of remarkable power. Three times the
first day and twice the second morning she and Isobel
had the joy of seeing their loved ones creeping along
the abyss bottom at places where the sun pierced down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
through the gloom. They missed other chances because
the ca&ntilde;on edge was not everywhere so easily
approachable.</p>
<p>Many times the flash of Blake&#8217;s revolver passed unseen
by them. Sometimes they had been forced away
from the brink; sometimes the depths were cut off from
their view by juttings of the vast walls. Yet now and
again one or the other caught a flash that marked the
advance of the explorers.</p>
<p>Towards midday a last flash was seen by both above
the turn where the ca&ntilde;on curved to run towards Dry
Fork Gulch. Between this point and the sharp bend
opposite the gulch the precipices overhung the ca&ntilde;on
bottom. Carrying the baby, the two hastened to the
bend, to heap up and light a great beacon fire of green
wood.</p>
<p>Gowan followed with the ponies, cool, silent and
efficient. From the first he had seldom looked over
into the ca&ntilde;on. His part was to serve Miss Chuckie
and her friend, and wait. Like Ashton, he had failed
to surmise the real significance of that tender parting
between Blake and Isobel. His look had betrayed
boundless amazement when he saw the wife of the man
take the sobbing girl into her arms and comfort her.
But he had spoken no word of inquiry; and every moment
since, both ladies had been too utterly absorbed
in their watch to talk to him of anything else.</p>
<p>At last the exploration was nearing the turning point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
Genevieve and Isobel lay on the edge of the precipice
near the beacon fire, peering down for the flash that
would tell of the last rod reading.</p>
<p>Slowly the minutes dragged by, and no welcome
signal flashed through the dark shadows. The usual
interval between shots had passed. Still no signal.
They waited and watched, with fast-mounting apprehension.
Could the brave ones down in those fearsome
depths have failed almost in sight of the goal? or
could misfortune have overtaken them in that narrow,
cavernous reach of the chasm so close to their objective
point?</p>
<p>At last&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;There! there it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Together the two watchers saw the flash, and together
they shrieked the glad discovery.</p>
<p>Genevieve rose to go to her crying baby. Before
she could silence him, Isobel screamed to her: &#8220;Another
shot!&ndash;&ndash;farther downstream! What can it
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve put down the still-sobbing baby and ran
again to the verge of the precipice. Two minutes
after the second flash there came a third, a few yards
still farther along the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have changed their plans. They are going
downstream,&#8221; said Genevieve.</p>
<p>She caught up the long pole of the flag and ran to
thrust it out opposite the point where she had seen the
flash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>Gowan was preparing for the return trip up along
the ca&ntilde;on to the starting point. At Isobel&#8217;s call, he
silently turned the ponies about the other way and followed
the excited watchers. As he did so, the girl
perceived a fourth flash in the abyss, a hundred yards
farther downstream. She hastened with the flag to a
point a little beyond the place.</p>
<p>When Genevieve had quieted the baby and overtaken
Isobel, the latter was ready with a question:
&#8220;You know Tom so well. Why is he going on down?
He said that he would at once return after reaching the
place where the head of the tunnel is to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have seen the beacon,&#8221; replied Genevieve.
&#8220;He could not have mistaken that. Something has
forced him to change his plans. It may be they were
swept down some place in the river that he knows they
cannot re-ascend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! do not say it!&#8221; sobbed the girl. &#8220;If they
cannot get back&ndash;&ndash;oh! what will they do? How
will they ever escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no other place?&#8221; asked Genevieve.
&#8220;Think, dear. Is there no break in these terrible
precipices?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a place where the wall slopes back&ndash;&ndash;but
steep, oh, so steep! Yet it is barely possible&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
The girl&#8217;s voice sank, and she glanced about at Gowan.
&#8220;It is just this side of where more than five thousand
sheep were driven over into the ca&ntilde;on. That was four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
years ago. I have never since been able to go near the
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom said that he rode all along the ca&ntilde;on for
miles. You say it may be possible to climb up at that
place. He must have seen it, and he has remembered
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that if it is possible for anyone to climb
the wall, Tom will climb it&ndash;&ndash;and he will bring up
Lafayette with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Genevieve! You are so strong! so full of
hope!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not hope, dear. It is trust. I know Tom better
than you. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another flash!&#8221; cried Isobel. &#8220;So soon, yet all
that long way from the last! They are traveling far
faster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they have finished with the levels,&#8221; divined
Genevieve. &#8220;We must hasten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isobel called the news to the silent puncher, and all
moved along to overtake the hurrying fugitives below.
Though both parties went so much faster, Blake&#8217;s frequent
shots kept the anxious watchers above in closer
touch than at any time before.</p>
<p>At last they came to that Cyclopean ladder of precipices,
rising one above the other in narrow steps, and
all inclined at a giddy pitch far steeper than any house
roof. Yet for a long way down them the field glasses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
showed their surfaces wrinkled with shelves and projecting
ledges and creased with faults and crevices.</p>
<p>The party went past this semi-break in the sheer
wall, and halted on the out-jutting point of the rim
where the luckless flock of sheep had been driven over
to destruction. No reference was made to that ruthless
slaughter of innocents. Gowan calmly set about
preparing a camp. The ladies lay down to watch in
the shade of a frost-cracked rock on the verge of the
wall.</p>
<p>Already the time had come and gone for the regular
signal of the revolver shot. The watchers began
to grow apprehensive. Still their straining eyes saw
no flash in the depths. A half hour passed. Their
apprehension deepened to dread. An hour&ndash;&ndash;they
were white with terror.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tiny red spot appeared&ndash;&ndash;not a flash that
came and went like lightning, but a flame that remained
and grew larger.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fire!&#8221; cried Isobel. &#8220;They have halted and
built a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve brought the flag and thrust it out over
the edge. The inner end of the pole she wedged in
a crevice of the split rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have stopped to rest,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may
be that Lafayette is worn out. But soon I trust they
will be coming up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked through her glasses. The fire was burning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
its brightest. She discerned the prostrate figure
beside the ledge. She watched it fixedly. Soon another
figure appeared in the circle of firelight. It bent
over the first, doing something with pieces of stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; whispered Genevieve, handing the glasses
to her companion, &#8220;Tom is hurt. Lafayette is binding
his leg. It is broken or badly strained.&ndash;&ndash;Oh!
will your father never come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom hurt? It can&#8217;t be&ndash;&ndash;no, no!&#8221; protested
Isobel. But she too looked and saw. After a time
she added breathlessly: &#8220;It can&#8217;t be so bad! Lafe
is helping him to rise.... They are starting this
way&ndash;&ndash;to the foot of the wall! They will be climbing
up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if his leg is injured!&#8221; differed Genevieve.</p>
<p>Again they waited. Presently the fire scattered,
and a streak of flame traveled across the ca&ntilde;on to a
point beneath them. Soon the red spot of a new fire
glowed in the shadows so directly under them that a
pebble dropped from their fingers must have grazed
down the precipices and fallen into the flames.</p>
<p>After several minutes of alternate peering through
the glasses, Genevieve handed them back to Isobel for
the third time, and rose to go to her baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Tom alone,&#8221; she said, divining the truth.
&#8220;Lafayette has helped him to the best place they could
find, and now he is coming up to us for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she had fed the baby and soothed him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
sleep, she laid out bandages and salve, set a full coffeepot
on the fire started by Gowan, and examined the
cream and eggs brought back by the puncher on his
second night trip to the ranch.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour had passed when Isobel called in
joyous excitement: &#8220;I see him! I see him! Down
there where the sunlight slants on the rocks. Oh! how
bravely! how swiftly he climbs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve went to take the glasses and look. Several
moments were lost before she could locate the tiny
figure creeping up that stairway of the giants. But,
once she had fixed the glasses upon him, she could see
him clearly. Isobel had well expressed it when she
said that he was climbing swiftly and bravely. Running
along shelves, clambering ledges, following up
the crevices that offered the best foothold, the tattered
climber fought his dizzy way upwards, upwards, ever
upwards!</p>
<p>Rarely, after some particularly hard scramble, he
flung himself down on a shelf or on one of the steps
of the Titanic ladder, to rest and summon energy for
another upward rush. His good fortune seemed as
marvelous as his endurance and daring. He never
once slipped and never once had to turn back from an
ascent. As if guided by instinct or divine intuition,
he chose always the safest, the least difficult, the most
continuously scalable way on all that perilous pitch.</p>
<p>So swift an ascent was beyond the ordinary powers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
of man. It could have been made only by a maniac
or by one to whom great passion had given command
of those latent forces of the body that enable the
maniac to fling strong men about like children. Long
before the climber reached the top of that terrible ladder,
his hands were torn and bleeding, the tattered
garments were half rent from his limbs and body, his
eyes were sunk deep in their sockets.</p>
<p>Yet ever he climbed, ledge above ledge, crevice after
crevice, until at last only one steep pitch rose above
him. A rope came sliding down the rock. A voice&ndash;&ndash;the
sweetest voice in all the wide world of sunshine
and life&ndash;&ndash;called to him. It sounded very far away,
farther than the bounds of reality, yet he heard and
obeyed. He slipped the loop of the rope down over
his shoulders and about his heaving forebody. Then
suddenly his labor was lightened. His leaden body
became winged. It floated upwards.</p>
<p>When he came to himself, a bitter refreshing wetness
was soothing his parched mouth and black swollen
tongue; gentle fingers were spreading balm on his torn
hands; the loveliest face of earth or heaven was downbent
over him, its tender blue eyes brimming with tears
of compassion and love. Softly his head and shoulders
were raised, and hot coffee was poured down his throat
as fast as he could swallow.</p>
<p>He half roused from his daze. The swollen,
cracked lips moved in faintly muttered words: &#8220;Leg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
broken&ndash;&ndash;sends love&ndash;&ndash;doing fine&ndash;&ndash;project feasible&ndash;&ndash;irrigation&ndash;&ndash;no
food&ndash;&ndash;must rest&ndash;&ndash;go down
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the two ministering angels met. Genevieve
bent down and pressed her lips to the purple,
swollen-veined forehead. The heavy lids closed over
the sunken eyes; but before he lapsed into the torpid
sleep of exhaustion that fell upon him, the two succeeded
in feeding him several spoonfuls of raw egg
beaten in cream. He then sank into utter unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Flaccid and inert as a corpse, he lay outstretched on
the grassy slope while they bound up the cuts and
bruises on his naked arms and shoulders and cut the
broken, gaping boots from his bruised feet. His legs,
doubly protected by the tough leather chapareras and
thick riding leggins, had fared less cruelly than his
arms, but his knees were raw and bleeding where the
chaps had worn through on the rocks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>LURKING BEASTS</h3>
</div>
<p>The moment that he had helped haul the climber
to safety Gowan had ridden away with the horses
to the camp. He now came jogging back with the
tent and all else that they had not been carrying with
them in their skirting of the ca&ntilde;on edge. He unloaded
the packs and hastened to pitch the tent.</p>
<p>As he was finishing, Isobel called to him sharply.
&#8220;What are you doing there, Kid? That can wait.
Come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Chuckie,&#8221; he replied with ready obedience.
But when he came down the slope to the little
group, his mouth was like a thin gash across his lean
jaws. He stared coldly at Ashton between narrowed
lids. &#8220;Want me to help tote him up by the fire?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she replied. &#8220;It is Tom! He is down
there&ndash;&ndash;his leg broken&ndash;&ndash;and no food! You must go
down to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go down?&#8221; queried the puncher. &#8220;What good
would that do? I couldn&#8217;t help him with that climb.
He weighs a good two hundred.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can take food down to him and let him know
that help is coming. You must!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan looked sullenly at the unconscious man.
&#8220;Sorry, Miss Chuckie. It&#8217;s no go. I ain&#8217;t a mountain
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>he</i> came up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s a sight easier going up
cliffs than climbing down. No, you&#8217;ll have to excuse
me, Miss Chuckie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flamed with indignant anger. &#8220;You coward!
You saw him come up, after all that time down
in those fearful depths&ndash;&ndash;after fighting his way all
those miles along the terrible river&ndash;&ndash;yet you dare not
go down! You coward! you quitter!&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher&#8217;s face turned a sickly yellow, and he
seemed to shrink in on himself. His voice sank to
a husky whisper: &#8220;You can say that, Miss Chuckie!
Any man say it, he&#8217;d be dead before now. If you
want to know, I&#8217;ve got a mighty good reason for not
wanting to go down. It ain&#8217;t that I&#8217;m afraid. You
can bank on that. It&#8217;s something else. I&#8217;ll go quick
enough&ndash;&ndash;but it&#8217;s got to be on one condition. You&#8217;ve
got to promise to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Marry you?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You know how I&#8217;ve felt towards you all
these years. Promise to marry me, and I&#8217;ll go to
hell and back for you. I&#8217;ll do anything for you. I&#8217;ll
save him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You cur! You&#8217;d force me to bargain myself to
you!&#8221; she cried, fairly beside herself with righteous
fury. &#8220;I thought you a man! You cur&ndash;&ndash;you cowardly
cur!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gowan turned from her and walked rapidly away
along the ca&ntilde;on edge, his head hunched between his
shoulders, his hands downstretched at his thighs, the
fingers crooked convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Genevieve. &#8220;You&#8217;ve driven him
away! Call him back! We need him! He must go
for help!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words shocked the girl out of her rash anger.
Her flushed face whitened with fear. &#8220;Kid!&#8221; she
screamed. &#8220;Come back, Kid! You must go to the
ranch&ndash;&ndash;bring the men!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry of appeal should have brought him back
to her on the run. It pierced high above the booming
reverberations of the ca&ntilde;on. Yet he paid no heed.
He neither halted nor paused nor even looked back.
If anything, he hurried away faster than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid! dear Kid! forgive me! Come back and help
us!&#8221; shrieked the girl.</p>
<p>He kept on down along the ca&ntilde;on rim, his chin sunk
on his breast, his downstretched hands bent like claws.
She ran a little way after him; only to flutter back
again, wringing her hands, distracted. &#8220;What shall
we do? what shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, dear&ndash;&ndash;be quiet!&#8221; urged Genevieve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve driven him away. We must do the best we
can. You must go yourself. I can stay and watch&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried Isobel. &#8220;The way he looked at
Lafe!&ndash;&ndash;I dare not go! He may come back&ndash;&ndash;and I
not here!&#8221;</p>
<p>She knelt to place her trembling hand on Ashton&#8217;s
forehead.</p>
<p>Genevieve looked at the setting sun. &#8220;There is no
time to lose,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Saddle my horse while I
nurse Baby. I cannot take him with me down the
mountain, in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Genevieve! You dare go&ndash;&ndash;at night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone must bring help, else Tom&ndash;&ndash;all alone
down in that dreadful chasm&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you may lose the way! I will go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, you must stay, Belle. I saw his eyes.
He may come back. I could not protect Lafayette,
but you&ndash;&ndash;There is no other way. I must leave
Baby, and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wondering at the courage of the young mother,
Isobel ran to saddle the oldest of the picketed horses.
He was the slowest of them all, but he was surefooted
and steady and very wise. When she brought him
down the ridge, Genevieve placed the newly fed baby
in her arms and went with the glasses to peer down the
sheer precipices. There in the blackness so far beneath
her the glowing fire illuminated an outstretched
form. It was her husband, lying flat on his back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
gazing up at the heights. Almost she could fancy that
he saw her as she saw him.</p>
<p>But she did not linger. Time was too precious.
She dropped him a kiss, and ran to spring upon the
waiting pony. She did not pause even to kiss the big-eyed
baby. The thirsty pony needed no urging to
start at a lively jog up the slope of the first ridge.
As he topped the crest and broke into a lope the sun
dipped below the western edge of High Mesa. A few
seconds later horse and rider disappeared from Isobel&#8217;s
anxious gaze down the far side of the ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Buck knows the trail,&#8221; murmured the girl.
&#8220;He knows he is headed for the waterhole. Yet if&ndash;&ndash;if
he <i>should</i> lose the trail!&#8221;</p>
<p>A spasm of fear sent her hand to the pistol hilt under
the fold of her skirt and twisted her head about. She
glared along the ca&ntilde;on rim. Gowan was still striding
away from her. She watched him fixedly, her hand
clutched fast on the hilt of her pistol, until he disappeared
around a mass of rocks.</p>
<p>The whinnying of the horses after their companion
at last drew her attention. They had not been watered
since the previous evening. Cuddling close the frightened
baby, the girl fetched a basin and one of the water
cans, to sponge out the dusty nostrils of the animals
and give each two or three swallows.</p>
<p>Then, when she had soothed the fretful child to
sleep, she laid him in a snug nest of blankets between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
a rock and a fallen tree, and went to watch beside Ashton.
He lay as she had left him, in a stupor of sleep
and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Gradually the twilight faded. Stars began to twinkle
in the cloudless sky. She watched and waited while
the dusk deepened. When she could barely see objects
a few yards away, she stooped over the unconscious
man and, putting out all her supple young strength,
half dragged, half carried him up the slope to a hiding
place that she had chosen, in under an overhanging
ledge. There she spread pine needles and blankets
on the soft mold and lifted him upon them, so that
nothing hard should press against his wounds.</p>
<p>The fire had burned low. It was a full hundred
yards away from the hiding place. She went to replenish
it and take a hasty look down at that outstretched
form in the depths. But soon she stole back
to the sleeping man under the rock, going, as she had
come, by a roundabout way in the darkness.</p>
<p>Night settled down close and dense over the plateau.
The girl crouched beside the sleeper, her eyes peering
out into the blackness, the drawn pistol ready in her
hand. She could see only a few feet in the dim starlight.
But her ears, accustomed to the dull monotone
of the booming ca&ntilde;on, heard every sound&ndash;&ndash;the click
of the horses&#8217; hoofs, even the munching of the nearest
one, the hoot of the owls that flitted overhead, the
distant yelps and wails of coyotes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></p>
<p>An hour passed, two hours&ndash;&ndash;a third. She crept
around to replenish the fire. When she returned she
heard the baby fretting. Swiftly she groped her way
to him and carried him to the hiding place, to quiet his
outcry. He sucked in a little of the beaten egg and
cream that she had ready for Ashton. It satisfied
his hunger, and he fell asleep, clasped against her soft
warm bosom. She crouched down with him in her lap,
her right hand again clasped on the pistol hilt, ready
for the expected attack.</p>
<p>She waited as before, silent, motionless, every sense
alert. Another hour dragged by, and another. Midnight
passed. Suddenly, on the ridge slope above her,
one of the horses snorted and plunged. She raised
the pistol. The horse became quiet. But something
came gliding around the rocks, a low form vaguely
outlined in the darkness. It might have been a creeping
man. It turned towards the hiding place. The
girl found herself looking into a pair of glaring eyes.
She thrust out the pistol, with her forefinger pointing
along the barrel. The darkness was too deep for her
to aim by the sights.</p>
<p>Before she could press the trigger, the beast bounded
away, with a snarl far deeper, far more ferocious than
any coyote could have uttered. The girl did not fire.
The wolf had seen the glint of her pistol barrel and
had fled. He would not return. But she shuddered
and drew the sleeping baby close as she thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
what might have happened had she left him alone in
the nest between the rock and the tree.</p>
<p>The precious, helpless child! He was of her own
blood, the son of her strong, splendid brother ... of
her brother, lying down there in those awful depths,
helpless&ndash;&ndash;in agony!...</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>CONFESSIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>A groping hand touched her arm; bandaged
fingers sought to feel who she was. Behind her
sounded a drowsy incoherent murmur. The snarl of
the wolf had roused the sleeper from his torpor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush&ndash;&ndash;hush!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;It is all well.
I am here by you. Lie still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isobel!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Isobel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear!&#8221; she soothed. &#8220;I am here. Rest&ndash;&ndash;go
to sleep again. All is well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All is&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; He roused a little more. &#8220;You
say&ndash;&ndash;Then he is safe! They have brought him up&ndash;&ndash;out
of that hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not lie outright. &#8220;He will soon be safe.
By morning help will have come to us. As soon as
the men can see to go down, they will descend for him.
They will bring him up the way that you have shown
us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice quivered with pride of what he had done.
She drew up his hand and pressed her lips tenderly
upon the bandages.</p>
<p>Had the caress been a burn, he could not have more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
quickly snatched the hand away. He sought to rise,
and struck his head against the overhanging rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I? Let me out!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you must not! Lie still! You must not!&#8221;
she remonstrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie still?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Lie still! with him
down there&ndash;&ndash;alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is night&ndash;&ndash;midnight. It will be hours before
even the moon rises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he down there&ndash;&ndash;alone! Help me make
ready. I am going down to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going down? But you cannot! It is midnight!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lantern. I shall take that. It will
be easier than in the daytime, for I shall not see those
sickening precipices below.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sought to creep out past her. She clutched his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! do not go! There is no need! Wait
until they come. You have done your share&ndash;&ndash;far
more than your share! Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I must go down to him.
I have no right to be up here, and he still down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must!&#8221; she urged, clinging tighter to his arm.
&#8220;You may fall. I am afraid! I cannot bear it! Do
not go! Stay with me&ndash;&ndash;say that you will stay with
me&ndash;&ndash;dearest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he cried, tearing himself away from
her, &#8220;To let you say it&ndash;&ndash;say it to me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Dearest, do not go!
There is no need! I cannot bear it! Do not go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need? My God! When I could fling myself
over, if it were not for him! To have let you say it&ndash;&ndash;to
me&ndash;&ndash;to a liar! thief! murderer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Hush! You are
delirious&ndash;&ndash;you do not know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is you who do not know!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But you
shall&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;all my cowardly baseness!&#8221;
The confession burst from him in a torrent of self-denunciation&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;That
trip to town, when we went to
fetch them, I lied to you about those bridge plans.
It was not true that I found them. He handed them
to me. He took no receipt. I looked at them and
saw how wonderful they were. I stole them. My
father had threatened to cast me off if I did not do
something worth while. I was desperate. So I stole
your brother&#8217;s plans. I copied them&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know about Tom!&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;But
of course. You saw me tell him, there at the ravine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you put your arms about his neck and kiss
him; but I did not hear&ndash;&ndash;I did not see the truth. I
believed&ndash;&ndash;that is the worst of it all&ndash;&ndash;I believed
it possible that you&ndash;&ndash;<i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;!... That devil Gowan.... But
that is no excuse. Had I not already doubted
you.... And I went down&ndash;&ndash;down into hell, with
only one purpose&ndash;&ndash;to make certain that he never
should come up again!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Christ!&#8221; whispered the girl&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Dear
Christ! He has gone mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Isobel,&#8221; he said, his voice slow and dead with
the calm of utter despair, &#8220;I am not mad. I have
never been mad except for a little while after you put
your arms about his neck. No&ndash;&ndash;For years I was a
fool, a profligate fool, wasting my life as I wasted
all those thousands of dollars that I had not earned.
I turned thief&ndash;&ndash;a despicable sneak thief. At last the
dirty crime found me out. I received a small share
of the punishment that I deserved. Then you took
me in&ndash;&ndash;without question&ndash;&ndash;treated me as a man.
God knows I tried to be one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were!&ndash;&ndash;you are!&#8221; she broke in. &#8220;This is
all a mistake&ndash;&ndash;a cruel, hideous mistake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to go,&#8221; he went on unflinchingly. &#8220;You
urged me to stay. I was weak. I could not force myself
to leave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&ndash;&ndash;because!&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the more reason why I should have gone,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;But I was weak, unfit. I lied to you and
won your pity. You gave me the chance to stay and
prove myself what I am. Down there, when he told
me what I should have guessed&ndash;&ndash;what I must have
guessed had not my own baseness blinded me to the
truth&ndash;&ndash;when he told me he was your brother, I saw
myself, my real self,&ndash;&ndash;my shriveled, black, hellish
soul. Now you see why I must go down again. I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
never make reparation for what I have done. But I
can at least go down to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You take all the blame on yourself!&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;What if I had confessed my secret, there
at the first, when Tom sprang down from the car and I
knew him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had told, then I should not have been
tempted to doubt you, and I should have gone on, it
might have been forever, with that lie and that theft
between us&ndash;&ndash;and I should not have been forced to
see, as I now see, my absolute unworthiness of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of me!&#8221; she cried shrilly, and she burst into wild
hysterical laughter. It broke off as abruptly as it began.
&#8220;Unworthy of me&ndash;&ndash;of me? the daughter of
a drunken mother, the sister of a girl who&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; A sob
choked her. She went on desperately: &#8220;You have
told me all. But I&ndash;&ndash;do you not wonder why I kept
silent&ndash;&ndash;why I denied Mary by my silence? You say
you sought to harm Tom&ndash;&ndash;down there. You did
not know he was my brother. You thought he would
harm me. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubted you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Because I failed to tell the truth. I
feared to hurt him&ndash;&ndash;to make trouble between him
and his rich, high-bred wife. As if I should not have
known better the moment I saw Genevieve! Dear sister!
she knows all. But you&ndash;&ndash;Either I should have
spoken, or I should have hidden all my fondness for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
him. But I could not hide my love for him&ndash;&ndash;and I
was ashamed to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashamed&ndash;&ndash;you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We lived in the slums. They told me my father
was a big man, a man such as Tom is now. He was
a railroad engineer. He was killed when I was a baby.
Then we sank into the slums. My mother&ndash;&ndash;she died
when I was twelve. There was then only Mary and
I and Tom. He could make only a little, working at
odd jobs. Mary and I worked in a factory. Even
she was under age. When I was going on fourteen
there came a terrible winter when thousands were out
of work. We almost starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;starved!&#8221; murmured Ashton. &#8220;Starved!
And I was starting in at college, flinging away money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom tried to force people to let him work,&#8221; the
girl went on drearily. &#8220;He was violent. They put
him in jail. Soon Mary and I had nothing left. There
was no work for us. We had sold everything that
anyone would buy. The rent was overdue. They
turned us out&ndash;&ndash;on the streets.... I was too young;
but Mary.... She found a place where I could stay.
They were decent people, but hard....</p>
<p>&#8220;The weather was bitterly cold. She was taken
sick. When the people with whom I was staying
heard what she had done, they refused to help. I
begged in the street. I was very small and thin. The&ndash;&ndash;the
beasts did not trouble me. Then, when Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
was very sick, I met Daddy. I begged from him. He
did not give me a nickel and pass on. He stopped and
made me talk&ndash;&ndash;he made me take him to Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had her moved to the best hospital.... It
was too late.... I also had pneumonia. They said I
would die. But Daddy brought me home just as soon
as I could be moved. The railroad was then a hundred
miles from Dry Mesa. But he kept me wrapped
in furs, and all the way he carried me in his arms. Do
you wonder why I love him so?... That is all.
You see now why I shrank from telling&ndash;&ndash;why I denied
Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in Heaven,&#8221; said Ashton&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;in Heaven,
where some day you will go. But I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
could see no more than the vague blotch of his white
face in the darkness, but his voice told her the anguish
of his look. &#8220;He was right&ndash;&ndash;your brother. He
told me that we always take with us the heaven or the
hell that we each have made for ourselves.... I have
lost you.... You know now why I am going down
to do the little that I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going down?&#8221; she asked wonderingly.
&#8220;You still say that you are going down? Yet I have
told you about&ndash;&ndash;Mary!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were she, I still would be utterly unfit to
look you in the face. I shall go to the camp for the
lantern. There were other gloves and some of my
clothing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They are all here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me where they are, and get ready the lantern
and bandages and a sack of food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going down,&#8221; she acquiesced. &#8220;You are
going to Tom. And you are coming up with him&ndash;&ndash;to
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is too much. I doubted you. Where are
those things? He is waiting down there alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is his child, my nephew,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hold
him while I go for what you need. Here is my pistol.
The man who shot you, who twice tried to murder you&ndash;&ndash;he
is somewhere up here. He will not harm me.
But you&ndash;&ndash;If he comes creeping in on you here, shoot
him as you would shoot a coyote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who shot me? He is up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen him every day since that first day
I met you,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;His name is Gowan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Gowan?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid Gowan, murderer! I saw his eyes as he
looked at you, lying down there on the brink. Then I
knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;if he&ndash;&ndash;Where is Genevieve? I cannot
go and leave you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&ndash;&ndash;you must! He is a coward. He dare
not follow you down that terrible place. No harm
will come to me if you are gone. But if he comes back
and finds you&ndash;&ndash;do you not see that if he kills you, he
must also kill me? But in the morning, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
others come&ndash;&ndash;Oh, why hasn&#8217;t Daddy come? All
this long time since you went down into the depths,
and he not with us! If only he were here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Genevieve?&#8221; again inquired Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has gone. She started down the mountain
for help when Kid went away. I&#8217;m so afraid for you,
dear! He may be creeping back now&ndash;&ndash;he may be
waiting already, close by here, in the darkness. But
if he has not heard our voices, he will go first to where
you came up, and then to the tent. Keep quiet until I
return. Wait; here is cream and egg. Drink it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he had drained the bowl that she held to his
lips, she crept away. Ashton sat still, the warm, soft
little body of the sleeping baby in his arms, the pistol
in his bandaged right hand. In her excitement Isobel
had forgotten his bound fingers. If Gowan had come
on him then, he would have put the baby back in under
the rock, and faced the puncher&#8217;s revolver with a smile.
What had he now to live for? He had lost her. She
had not yet grasped the baseness of what he had
thought and done. As soon as she realized ... And
he could never forgive himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>OVER THE BRINK</h3>
</div>
<p>Isobel came back to him, noiselessly gliding around
through the darkness. She set down the bundle
she was carrying, and hung blankets over the entrance
of the little cave. She then lighted the lantern. He
held out his bound hands. She unbound them enough
for him to use his fingers, and taking the baby and the
pistol, crouched down, with her ear close to the screening
blankets, while he exchanged his tattered clothes
for those she had brought to him.</p>
<p>There were also his change of boots and a pair of
Blake&#8217;s gauntlet gloves, into which he was able to force
his slender fingers without removing the remaining
bandages. Isobel had already bound up into a kind
of knapsack the food and clothing and first-aid package
that he was to take down to her injured brother.
He slung it upon his back, and whispered that he was
ready.</p>
<p>She nestled the baby in the warm blankets on which
he had lain, wrapped a blanket about the lantern, and
led him cautiously down to the brink of the chasm.
Dark as was the night about them, it was bright compared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
with the intense blackness of that profound
abyss. The girl caught his arm and shrank back from
the edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not fall? you are certain you will not
fall?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot fall,&#8221; he answered with calm conviction.
&#8220;He needs me. I am going down to him. Besides,
it will be easier with the lantern than if I could see below.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not uncover the light until you are down over
the edge.&ndash;&ndash;Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stooped to knot the rope that he had brought
up from the depths, to the lariats with which he had
been dragged up the last ledges. She looped the end
about his waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall at least be able to help
you down the first fifty yards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you and keep you! Good-by!&#8221; he murmured
in a choking voice, and he hastily crept down
to slip over the first ledge of that night-shrouded Cyclopean
ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lafe!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Surely you do not mean
to go without first telling me&ndash;&ndash;I cannot let you go
until&ndash;&ndash;If you should fall! Wait, dearest! Kiss
me&ndash;&ndash;tell me that you&ndash;&ndash;Oh, if you should fall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not fall; I cannot. Good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dim white blotch of his face disappeared below
the verge. The line jerked through the girl&#8217;s hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
She clutched it with frantic strength and flung herself
back with her feet braced against a point of rock.
After a moment of tense straining, the rope slackened,
and his voice came up to her over the ledge: &#8220;Pay
out, please. It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ve found a crevice.&#8221;</p>
<p>She eased off on the line a few inches at a time,
but always keeping it taut and always holding herself
braced for a sudden jerk. At last the end came into
her hand. She had to lie out on the rim-rock and
call down to him. He called back in a tone of quiet
assurance. The line slackened. He had cast it loose.
The lantern glowed out in the blackness and showed
him standing on a narrow shelf.</p>
<p>As Isobel bent lower to gaze at him, a frightful
scream rang out above the booming of the ca&ntilde;on. It
was a shriek such as a woman would utter in mortal
fear. The girl drew back from the verge, her hair
stiffening with horror. Could it be possible that Genevieve
had lost her way and was wandering back to
camp, and that Gowan&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Again the fearful scream pierced the air. Isobel
looked quickly across towards the far side of the ca&ntilde;on.
She could see nothing, but she drew in a deep sigh of
relief. The second cry had told her that it was only
a mountain lion, over on the other brink of the chasm.</p>
<p>When she again looked down at Ashton he was descending
a crevice with a rapidity that brought her
heart into her mouth. Yet there was no hurry in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
quick movements, and every little while he paused on
a shelf to peer at the steep slope immediately below
him. Soon the circle of lantern light became smaller
and dimmer to the anxious watcher above. Steadily
it waned until all she could see was a little point of light
far down in the darkness&ndash;&ndash;and always it grew smaller
and fainter.</p>
<p>Lying there with her bosom pressed against the hard
stone, her straining eyes fixed on that lessening point
of light, she had lost all count of time. Her whole
soul was in her eyes, watching, watching, watching lest
that tiny light should suddenly shoot down like a meteor
and vanish in the darkness. Many times it disappeared,
but never in swift downward flight, and always
it reappeared.</p>
<p>Not until the moon came gliding up above the lofty
white crests of the snowy range did she think of aught
else than that speck of light and of him who was bearing
it down into the black depths. But the glint of
moonlight on a crystalline stone broke her steadfast
gaze. Before she could again fix it on the faint point
of lantern light a sound that had been knocking at the
threshold of her consciousness at last made itself
heard. It was an intermittent clinking as of steel on
stone.</p>
<p>She looked around, thinking that one of the horses
was walking along the ridge slope with a loose shoe.
But all were standing motionless in the moonlight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
dozing. Again she heard the click, and this time she
located the direction from which it came. She looked
at the split rock on the edge of the sheer drop. From
beside it she had peered down through the field glasses
at the outstretched form of her brother, far beneath in
the ca&ntilde;on bottom.</p>
<p>The sound came from that rock. She stared at the
side of the frost-split fragment with dilated eyes. The
crack between the loose outer bowlder and the main
mass showed very black and wide in the moonlight.
Could it be possible that it had widened&ndash;&ndash;that it was
slipping over? And her brother down there beneath
it!...</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By setting wedge-shaped stones in the top of the cleft
rock and prying with the crowbar, Gowan had gradually
canted the top of the loose outer bowlder towards
the edge of the precipice. It had only to topple forward
in order to plunge down the ca&ntilde;on wall. He
was working as silently as he could, but with a fierce
eagerness that caused an occasional slip of the crowbar
on the rock.</p>
<p>Although the great block of stone weighed over two
tons, its base was small and rounded, and the mass behind
it gave him leverage for his bar. Every inch
that he pried it forward, the stones slipped farther
down into the widening crack and held the vantage
he had gained. Already the bowlder had been pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
out at the top many inches. It was almost balanced.
The time had come to see if he could not pry it over
with a single heave.</p>
<p>He did not propose to fall over after the rock. He
turned his face to the brink, set the end of the bar in
the crevice, and braced himself to heave backwards
on the outer end. He put his weight on it and pulled.
He could feel the rock give&ndash;&ndash;the top was moving
outward. A little more, and it must topple over.</p>
<p>Close behind him spoke a voice so hoarse and low-pitched
with horror that it sounded like a man&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Drop
that bar! drop it!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the swiftness of a wolf, he bounded sideways
along the rim-rock. In the same lightning movement,
he whirled face about and whipped his Colt&#8217;s from its
holster. His finger was crooking against the trigger
before he saw who it was that confronted him. The
hammer fell in the same instant that he twitched the
muzzle up and sideways. The heavy bullet scorched
the girl&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<p>Above the crashing report rose a wild cry, &#8220;Miss
Chuckie&ndash;&ndash;God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Through the blinding, stinging powder-smoke she
saw him stagger backwards as if to flee from what he
thought he had done. His foot went down over the
sharp edge. He flung up his hands and dropped into
the abyss.</p>
<p>She did not shriek. She could not. Her tongue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
clove to the roof of her mouth. Her heart stopped
beating. She crumpled down and lay gasping. But
the fascination of horror spurred her to struggle to her
knees and creep over to peer down from the place
where he had fallen.</p>
<p>Beneath her was only blank, utter darkness. No
sound came up out of the deep except only that ceaseless
reverberation of the hidden river. Twelve hundred
feet down, the falling man had struck glancingly
upon the smooth side of an out-jutting rock and his
crushed body had been flung far out and sideways. It
plunged into the rapids below the barrier and was borne
away down the ca&ntilde;on. But this the girl could not have
seen even in midday.</p>
<p>She looked for the red star of the distant fire where
she knew her brother was lying. She could not see
it. The point upon which the falling man had struck
shut off her view. The other side of the split rock
was where she and Genevieve had looked down through
the glasses and seen Blake. She failed to realize the
difference in the change of position. Her horror deepened.
She thought that Gowan had hurled straight
down to the bottom with all the terrific velocity of
that sheer drop, and that he had plunged upon the fire
and upon the dear form outstretched beside it, to crush
and mangle and be crushed and mangled. The thought
was too frightful for human endurance.</p>
<p>A long time she lay in a swoon, her head on the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
edge of the brink. It was the wailing of the hungry,
frightened baby that at last called her back to life and
action. She dragged herself up around to the hiding
place. The neglected baby was not easy to quiet. The
cream had soured. There was nothing that she could
give him except water. All the eggs that were left
she had put in the knapsack that Ashton was carrying
down to her brother. The baby now showed the full
reflex of his mother&#8217;s long hours of anxiety and fear.
He fretted and cried and would not be comforted.</p>
<p>The chill of approaching dawn forced her to rebuild
the outburnt fire. The warm glow and the play
of the flames diverted the child and hushed his outcry.
Holding him so that he might continue to watch the
dancing tongues of fire, the girl sat motionless, going
over and over again in her mind all that had occurred
since the tattered, bleeding, purple-faced climber had
come straining up out of the depths.... It could not
have happened&ndash;&ndash;it was all a hideous dream....
Would they never come? Must she sit here forever&ndash;&ndash;alone!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>FRIENDS IN NEED</h3>
</div>
<p>Because of the moonlight she did not heed the
graying of the east. But the whinnying of the
picketed horses roused her from the apathy of misery
into which she had sunk. She stood up and looked
along the ridge. A small roundish object appeared
above the crest&ndash;&ndash;then others. They rose quickly&ndash;&ndash;the
heads of riders spurring their horses up the far
side of the ridge.</p>
<p>Singly, in pairs, in groups, the rescuers burst up into
view and came loping down to her, shouting and waving.
In the lead rode her father and the sheriff; in
the midst Genevieve, between two attendant young
punchers. In all, there were nearly two dozen eager,
resolute men, everyone an admiring friend of Miss
Chuckie, everyone zealous to serve her and hers.</p>
<p>The girl stood waiting beside the fire. She had tried
to run to meet them and found that she could not move.
The suddenness of their coming after all that fearful
night of waiting seemed to numb her limbs.</p>
<p>They rushed down upon her, waving, shouting questions.
Her father, on Rocket, was the first to reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
her. He sprang off and ran to put his arm about her
quivering shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey! it&#8217;s all right now!&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;We&#8217;re here with everything that&#8217;s needed. We&#8217;ll
soon yank him up out of that hole!&#8221;</p>
<p>The baby, frightened by the rush and tumult of the
off-leaping riders, began to scream. Someone took
him from the girl&#8217;s arms and handed him to his mother
as she was lifted down out of her saddle. Isobel
pressed her face against her father&#8217;s sweaty breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Miss Chuckie!&#8221; sang out one of the
men. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let go yet. Where&#8217;s Gowan&ndash;&ndash;Kid
Gowan?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered convulsively, yet managed to reply:
&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;was trying to&ndash;&ndash;to roll the rock down. Tom,
my brother, is right below it. I heard and came to
see. His back was to me. I could not shoot&ndash;&ndash;I
could not raise my pistol. When I spoke, he whirled
and shot at me. He&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid&ndash;&ndash;shot at you?&#8221; cried Knowles. &#8220;At you?
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t possible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean to. He fired before he saw who
I was. Then he saw. He forgot everything&ndash;&ndash;everything
except that he had shot at me. He backed
off&ndash;&ndash;there&ndash;&ndash;over the edge!&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden hush fell on the excited crowd. One man
went to peer down from the place to which the girl
had pointed. He came back softly. &#8220;Same place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
where the last bunch of sheep went over,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Rest of us were pretty sick&ndash;&ndash;ready to quit. He
kept after them until the last ewe jumped. Said they&#8217;d
gone to hell, where they belonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s gone there!&#8221; said the sheriff.
&#8220;Look at the way this bowlder is pried loose, ready
to roll over! Once heard tell that his real dad
was Billie the Kid. Some of you mayn&#8217;t have heard
tell of Billie. He was the coldest blooded, promiscuous
murderer of them days when we used to drive
from Texas to Montana and the boys used to shoot-up
towns and each other just for fun. Well, this Kid
Gowan has got Billie&#8217;s eyes and slit mouth. Can&#8217;t say
I ever took to him, but seeing as how he was a crack-up
puncher and Wes Knowles&#8217; foreman&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! I can&#8217;t understand it&ndash;&ndash;Kid has been
almost like a son to me all these years!&#8221; complained
Knowles perplexedly. He explained to his daughter.
&#8220;You&#8217;re wondering why I didn&#8217;t come sooner, honey.
Those Utes had been let go. We had to follow them
up a long ways. When we got them back and put
them on that trail from the waterhole, they found it
led straight across the flats to where the horses and
wagon had stood. There the tracks of the Indian
shoes ended, and the tracks of shod hoofs led off into
the brush. We followed them all the way &#8217;round to
the lower waterhole and up the lower creek to the
ranch, and there they took us right to Rocket&#8217;s heels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
The Jap said Kid had his saddle in the wagon when
he came back from town, and he had a new hat. Mr.
Blake did some hot shooting at that assassin on the
hill. So, putting two and two together&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy, I know&ndash;&ndash;I knew when I saw him
look at Lafe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Knowles choked back the epithet.
&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Blake told us about that&ndash;&ndash;and about her
husband! Jumping Jehosaphat! Think of his being
your brother! You must have been plumb locoed, to
keep still about that! Why didn&#8217;t you tell us, honey?&ndash;&ndash;leastways
me, your Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;But about Genevieve? Tell me. You
could have come sooner if she&ndash;&ndash;Was she lost? I
was sure that pony&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better have given her a fast one. It came on so
dark before he was half down the mountain that she
was knocked out of the saddle by a branch. He went
on down to the waterhole. She tried to catch him&ndash;&ndash;couldn&#8217;t.
Got lost and wandered all around before
she got down to the waterhole and caught him. We
had got to the ranch at dusk, and all the posse had
turned in for the night. She came loping down the
divide just after moonrise. We started as soon as
we could rake up all the picket-pins and rope. Wanted
Mrs. Blake to wait and come on later; but talk about
grit! We simply couldn&#8217;t make her stay behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isobel thrust herself free from her father&#8217;s arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
and darted out through the circle of rugged, earnest-faced
punchers and cowmen to where Genevieve lay
resting with the baby clasped to her bosom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear! you poor dear!&#8221; she murmured, kneeling
to stroke the head of the weary young mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall soon be rested,&#8221; replied Genevieve.
&#8220;How about Tom? Have you kept watch of him?
Has he moved?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl shrank back, unable to face her sister-in-law&#8217;s
eager look.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;The fire&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;it disappeared, and
I could not see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve smiled, and the reddening dawn lent a
trace of color to her pale face. &#8220;It was a good sign.
He could not have been suffering so much. He must
have slept, and the fire died down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you think that was it?&#8221; sighed Isobel. &#8220;I
feared&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not say what it was she had feared. As
she paused Genevieve looked up into her agitated face
and asked quickly: &#8220;But Lafayette? Is he still
sleeping?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, where&#8217;s Lafe, honey?&#8221; inquired Knowles.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to roust him out to tell us just what way
he came up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I told you?&#8221; cried Isobel, her head still
in a whirl of conflicting emotions. Then, as tersely and
quietly as her father would have related it, she told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
the bald facts of how Ashton had been wakened by the
snarl of the wolf, how he had insisted upon going back
to help her brother, and how he had gone down into
the darkness, the pack and lantern slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;By&ndash;&ndash;James!&#8221; vowed Knowles, when she had
finished. &#8220;Any man on the Western Slope say that
boy&#8217;s not acclimated, he&#8217;d better look for another climate
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentleman,&#8221; the sheriff addressed the exclaiming
crowd, &#8220;you heard tell what the little lady had to say
about her husband and this Lafe Ashton going down
into Deep Ca&ntilde;on, where no man ever went before.
Now Miss Chuckie has told us again how Ashton
climbed up here, where no man in this section had a
notion anything short of a mountain sheep could climb.
Well, what does the gritty kid do but turn round and
climb down again&ndash;&ndash;in the dark, mind you! They&#8217;re
down there now, both of them&ndash;&ndash;down in the bottom
of Deep Ca&ntilde;on. We called them tenderfeet, that day
when Mr. Blake honored our county seat by sidetracking
his palatial car. Boys, down there in that hole are
the two nerviest men I ever heard tell about. One of
&#8217;em has a broken leg. The other has broke the trail
for us. I ask for volunteers to go down with me and
yank &#8217;em up out of there. Gentlemen, who offers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the crowd surged forward. Every man
shouted, whooped, struggled to thrust himself ahead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
of the others and force the acceptance of his services on
the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, boys!&#8221; he remonstrated. &#8220;Just hold
your hawsses. I didn&#8217;t ask for a stampede. You
can&#8217;t all go down. Last man over might get in a hurry
to catch the first, and start a manslide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote we set a thirty-year limit,&#8221; put in one of the
younger punchers.</p>
<p>This raised a clamor of dissent from the older men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what,&#8221; shouted another. &#8220;Let Miss
Chuckie cut out the lucky ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket&ndash;&ndash;Now you&#8217;re talking!&#8221;
Every man shouted approval, and fell silent as Isobel
sprang up from beside Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; she exclaimed, her eyes radiant, &#8220;it&#8217;s
such times as these that makes life grand! I believe
six of you would be enough, but I&#8217;ll make it ten. First,
I&#8217;m going to bar everyone who has a wife or children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t include me, honey,&#8221; hastily protested
her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you come in the next&ndash;&ndash;none over thirty-five
nor under twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>A groan arose from some of the youngsters, but the
older men took their disappointment in stolid silence.
She went on with calm decisiveness: &#8220;Now those of
you that have done any considerable mountain climbing
afoot this summer, please step this way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></p>
<p>Two members of a recently disbanded surveying
party, four punchers who had tried their luck at prospecting
on the snowy range, and three wild horse hunters
sprang forward in response to the request.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said the sheriff. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to
own up to being forty. But I&#8217;m leading this here
posse, and I&#8217;ll eat my hat if I can&#8217;t outclimb anything
on two legs in this county. String out your ropes, boys,
and pass over all them picket-pins. We&#8217;ll need a purchase
now and again, I figure, hauling up Mr. Blake.
Hustle! Here&#8217;s the sun clean up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the brusquely jovial directions of their leader,
the lucky nine divested themselves of spurs and cartridge
belts, tied themselves to the line at intervals of
several feet, and promptly started down the dizzy
ledges. The others helped them during the first fifty
yards of descent with the line that Isobel had drawn
up after it had been cast loose by Ashton. They then
gathered along the brink, enviously watching the descent
of their companions into the shadowy abyss.</p>
<p>Genevieve came to where Isobel and her father
crouched beside the others. &#8220;Thomas will not let
me put him down, Belle,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I see you left
the glasses beside the rock. If Lafayette has reached
the bottom safely&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;safely!&#8221; echoed Isobel. &#8220;Daddy, you look&ndash;&ndash;quick,
please!&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles hastened to skirt along the brink to where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
the little field glasses lay at the near side of the split
rock. The two followed him, Genevieve smiling with
pleasant anticipation, Isobel trembling with doubt and
dread. The cowman stretched out on the rim shelf
and peered over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m-m,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Can&#8217;t see anything
down there. Too dark yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look straight below you,&#8221; said Genevieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey?&ndash;&ndash;Uh! By&ndash;&ndash;James! Well, if that ain&#8217;t
a picture now! These sure are mighty fine little
glasses, ma&#8217;am. I can see &#8217;em plain as day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them?&ndash;&ndash;you say &#8216;them,&#8217; Daddy?&#8221; cried Isobel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Come and look for yourself. Guess Lafe
is fixing Mr. Blake&#8217;s leg.&ndash;&ndash;Which reminds me, honey,
that before we left the ranch, Mrs. Blake had me send
for that lunger sawbones that&#8217;s come to live at Stockchute.
He&#8217;ll be here, I figure, before or soon after
the boys get Mr. Blake up into God&#8217;s sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Tom, Daddy&ndash;&ndash;you mean my Brother
Tom!&#8221; joyfully corrected the girl as she took the
glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got to give me time to chew on it,
honey. It&#8217;s come too sudden for me to take it all
in.&#8221; He stood up and gazed gravely at the smiling
mother and her comforted baby. &#8220;Hum-m-m. Then
that yearling is my Chuckie&#8217;s own blood nephew.
Well, ma&#8217;am, what do <i>you</i> think of it, if I may ask?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you make it &#8216;Jenny,&#8217; Uncle Wes?&#8221; asked
Genevieve.</p>
<p>He stared at her blankly. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t adopt
him, ma&#8217;am&ndash;&ndash;only her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the brother of your dear daughter, and I
am his wife. Come now,&#8221; she coaxed, &#8220;you must admit
that brings me near enough to call you &#8216;Uncle
Wes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me, ma&#8217;am&ndash;&ndash;Jenny. I give in, I
throw up the fight. That irrigation project now&ndash;&ndash;Chuckie&#8217;s
brother can have anything of mine he asks
for. Only there&#8217;s one thing&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve got to make
that yearling say &#8216;Granddad&#8217; when he talks to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oh!&#8221; cooed Genevieve. &#8220;To think you feel
that way towards him! Of course he shall say it.
And I&ndash;&ndash;Will you not allow me to make it
&#8216;Daddy&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not resist her enticingly upturned lips. He
brushed down his bristly mustache, and bent over awkwardly,
to kiss his new daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you were one of those super-high-toned
ladies, m&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;Jenny,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>The cultured child of millions smiled up at him reproachfully.
&#8220;What! after I have been with you so
long, Daddy? But it&#8217;s true there was a time&ndash;&ndash;before
Tom taught me that men cannot be judged by
mere polish and veneer, or the lack of polish and veneer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span></p>
<p>Isobel, all her doubts and fears allayed, had risen
from the precipice&#8217;s edge in time to hear Genevieve&#8217;s
reply. She added eagerly: &#8220;Nor should men be
judged by what they have been if they have become
something else&ndash;&ndash;if they have climbed up&ndash;&ndash;up out of
the depths!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belle! dear Sister Belle! Then he has proved
it to you? Oh, I am so glad for you! He has proved
to you that he has climbed&ndash;&ndash;to the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the very heights! I must tell Daddy. Give
me Thomas. See, he is fast asleep, the poor abused
little darling! Go and watch them, and our climbers.
They are going down like a string of mountain sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genevieve placed the baby in his aunt&#8217;s outstretched
arms and went to look into the abyss through the field
glasses. Isobel drew her father away, out of earshot
of the down-peering group of men. She stopped behind
the tent, which Gowan had pitched part way up
the slope of the ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to talk with me about Lafe, honey?&#8221;
surmised Knowles, as the girl started to speak and hesitated.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flamed scarlet, but she raised her shyly
lowered eyes and looked up at him with a clear, direct
gaze. &#8220;Yes, Daddy. He&ndash;&ndash;he loves me, and I&ndash;&ndash;love
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; said Knowles. His eyes contracted.
It was his only betrayal of the wrench she had given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
the tender heart within his tough exterior. &#8220;Well, I
figured it was bound to come some day. I&#8217;ve been
lucky not to lose you any time the last four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you do not say anything about him,
Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you cut him out of the herd?&#8221; he dryly
replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough for me, long as I know
he&#8217;s your choice and is square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has nothing; he is very poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the will to work. He&#8217;ll get there, with
you pushing on the reins. That&#8217;s how I size him
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Daddy, he told me he had been bad, very
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles searched the girl&#8217;s face, with a sudden up-leaping
of concern&ndash;&ndash;that vanished as quickly before
what he saw in her clear eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might have expected it of you, honey. You
stand by him. You&#8217;ve got sense enough to know what
it means when a man thinks enough of a girl to tell
her the wrong things he has done. I was wild, too,
when I was a youngster. There was a girl I thought
enough of to tell. She wasn&#8217;t your kind, honey. It
came near sending me to the devil for good. You
know better. No girl ought to be fool enough to
hitch up with a man to reform him. But if he has
already taken a brace and straightened the kinks out of
himself, that&#8217;s different.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He has come up, Daddy&ndash;&ndash;out of the depths.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowles only half caught her meaning. &#8220;Sure he
climbed up. That proves he has the grit and the nerve.
He had proved that even better, going down at the
other place. Put any man down there, and he&#8217;d make
a try to get out. No, the real test was his going back
down again. He might have come up just for himself.
But going down again&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the proof of
what&#8217;s in him; that&#8217;s what proves he&#8217;s white!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Daddy!... But I&#8217;m afraid. He thinks
he has been too bad ever to&ndash;&ndash;to marry me. I&#8217;m so
afraid he&#8217;ll go away and leave me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowman straightened up, his eyes glinting with
righteous indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Go &#8217;way and leave you?&ndash;&ndash;when you want
him to stay? By&ndash;&ndash;James! He&#8217;s going to stay!
Don&#8217;t you worry, honey. He&#8217;s going to stay, if I have
to rope and hogtie him for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl stared into the frowning face of her father.
There was no twinkle in the corner of his eyes. He
was absolutely serious. For the first time in over two
days her dimples flashed. Her eyes sparkled with
merriment. Her lips parted. But she checked the
gay laugh before it could burst out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she reproached herself. &#8220;How could I?
And they still down there&ndash;&ndash;and Tom suffering!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom?&#8221; repeated Knowles. &#8220;Thomas Blake&ndash;&ndash;your
brother! That&#8217;s why you got me started reading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
all those reports and engineering journals. You
guessed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not seem possible. Yet I could not help
hoping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things do happen our way&ndash;&ndash;sometimes,&#8221; qualified
Knowles. &#8220;Mrs. Blake&ndash;&ndash;Jenny&ndash;&ndash;says Lafe
brought up word that the project can be put through.
I meant to fight. But now&ndash;&ndash;he is your brother, and
he has done something no man ever before thought
could be done&ndash;&ndash;he has surveyed Deep Ca&ntilde;on. He
has me beat. I&#8217;ve told Mrs.&ndash;&ndash;Jenny straight out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he will do what is right by you, dear, dear
Daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s your brother, honey. That settles it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>RECLAMATION</h3>
</div>
<p>Even with the mutual assistance that they could
give one another, and with the certain knowledge
that the descent was possible, the rescuers had no easy
task following the trail &#8220;broken&#8221; by Ashton. Their
very numbers prevented them from going down as
fast as he had gone. On the other hand, those on the
upper part of the life-line could steady their companions
over ledges and down the steeper crevices, while
the leaders helped the ones who followed by hammering
footholds in the rock and at the very worst places
driving in picket-pins to hold the extra ropes brought
down for the purpose.</p>
<p>Still, Deep Ca&ntilde;on was Deep Ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;the ladder it
offered was a ladder of Titans. Many long hours of
waiting passed after the rescuing party disappeared
among the shadows less than a third of the way down
the steep-sloping precipices, before they came struggling
upwards again into view of the anxious watchers
on the brink. The sun had circled well over into the
western sky.</p>
<p>There was yet a thousand feet for the rescuers to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
clamber, hauling and pushing up in their midst the
heavy body of the injured engineer. All during the
first half of the ascent Blake had made the task as easy
as he could by the strenuous exertion of the great
strength still left in his arms and his sound leg. But
at last the bandages that bound his broken leg had
chafed in two on the rough ledges; and even his iron
nerve had not long been able to withstand the torture
of the twisting break.</p>
<p>He now dangled helpless in the sling by which they
had secured him. Half the time he was mercifully
unconscious; the other half his jaw was set rigid and
his lips were compressed to stifle his groans of agony.
Whenever possible Ashton climbed beside him, striving
to ease the roughness of the ascent.</p>
<p>A full hour before they reached the top, the thin-faced
consumptive surgeon arrived from Stockchute
with his splints and medical case. Waited upon by
Isobel and Genevieve, he was fully recovered from the
exertion of his ride when at last the panting rescuers
came toiling up to the brink.</p>
<p>Eager hands dragged the unconscious engineer to the
top and carried him to where the surgeon sat waiting.
A few of the watchers lingered to help the rescuers
over the rim; then they, too, hurried away to see if
Blake had survived that terrible ascent. For the last
two hundred feet he had looked like a dead man.
There was no cheering. Deep Ca&ntilde;on had been conquered;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
but it was yet to be seen whether the victory
had not been won at a disastrous cost.</p>
<p>The sheriff and his nine men sank down on the
grassy slope, gasping, outspent. Ashton collapsed in
their midst. He was more than outspent; he was utterly
exhausted. The instant he had seen Blake lifted
over the rim-rock, he had given way to the strain of his
frightful exertions. When a man sent by Isobel came
hurrying to the rescuers with water and coffee, Ashton
was unable to move or speak. The man had to hold
him up and pour the coffee down his throat.</p>
<p>One by one, the sheriff and the others staggered up
and went to join the silent group about Blake. No
one left that circle of watchers. They were waiting
for the result of the surgeon&#8217;s efforts to resuscitate the
unconscious man. It was a desperate fight. But the
surgeon had won a place in the forefront of his profession
before the white plague had driven him from
New York to this health-giving wilderness. He knew
all the latest, most wonderful methods of resuscitation.
And he had for assistants two who loved and were
loved by his patient.</p>
<p>When at last the announcement was made that the
engineer had come out of his swoon and probably
would live, the sheriff and all the members of the posse
not employ&eacute;s of Knowles prepared to ride down to
Plum Creek ranch for the night. The cowman ordered
his men to go down with the party, to water the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
horses and bring back food and water for the camp.
The surgeon had said that his patient could not be
moved for many days.</p>
<p>But before the party rode off, each man, from the
sheriff to the youngest of the punchers, came to where
Ashton was still lying on the grass, and took his limp
hand in theirs. They did not grip it, for the tattered
glove and shredded bandages were wet with blood;
nor did they put into speech what they thought of him.
A gruff word or two of fellowship and parting was all
they gave him. Yet he saw and knew that he had won
his place among these reddest blooded of all red-blooded
men.</p>
<p>When one of his fellow employ&eacute;s came to him, leading
Rocket, he sought to summon strength enough to
rise, but found that he could not even turn on his side.
He had driven his body to superhuman efforts. He
must now pay the price. At his request, he was lifted
up on Rocket, but he could not hold up his head, much
less his body. They laid him again on the grass, and
told Knowles his condition, before they rode off.</p>
<p>The cowman fetched the surgeon, who felt the pulse
of the exhausted man, gave him a pellet, and hastened
back to Blake. In a few moments Ashton&#8217;s feeble,
racing pulse became calm and slow, the wild whirl of
his thoughts lulled. He sank into profound slumber.</p>
<p>When he awoke the sun of another day was just
clearing the great white peaks of the snowy range. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
was outstretched on a soft bed of blankets spread over
a thick layer of pine needles. Above his face sloped
the roof of a small tent. He had been cared for&ndash;&ndash;but
there was no one watching at his bedside. He
thought he understood, and smiled in bitter resignation.</p>
<p>When he moved, racking pains shot through his
stiff muscles. Only the renewed life that surged
through his veins enabled him to turn and twist and
bend until the pains subsided to a dull aching and he
was able to command his limbs. His hands were
swathed fast in bandages. He tore them off with his
teeth until the fingers were free enough for use. After
much effort, he succeeded in forcing his swollen feet
into his boots.</p>
<p>In the midst Yuki, the Jap cook, appeared before the
low entrance of the tent and sank down on his knees
to set a trayful of food beside the occupant. He hissed
a pleasant, &#8220;Good morning, Mistah Lafe!&#8221; and was
gone before Ashton could reply. The aroma of hot
coffee and the savory smell of chicken broth forced
Ashton to forget all else than that he was famished.
Besides the coffee and broth, there was a nogg of eggs
and thick cream slightly flavored with whiskey. He
drank one liquid after the other with the greediness
of a starving man; nor did he stop until he had drained
the last drop of all three. He could have followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
with a hearty meal of solids, but the fluids were enough
to stimulate him to renewed energy.</p>
<p>He crept out of his tent and looked around. Up
where they had carried Blake from the precipices stood
a larger tent. Near it, under a low-growing pine, the
surgeon lay rolled in a blanket, fast asleep. Some distance
away, in the other direction, Yuki and two of
the ranch hands were building a stone fireplace. Beyond
them were picketed three horses, the nearest of
which was Rocket.</p>
<p>Ashton stood up and started rapidly towards the big
rawboned horse. Within a few yards, however, his
pace slackened. He faltered and stopped to look back
at the larger tent. After a pause, he turned about and
slowly approached the tent.</p>
<p>As he drew near he heard a murmur of voices barely
distinguishable above the booming of the ca&ntilde;on.
Again he faltered and stopped and stood hesitating.
The open front of the tent faced at right angles to
his line of approach. As he hesitated, he saw Isobel&#8217;s
head appear, veiled in the loose meshes of her chestnut
hair. She looked about towards him, and drew back
with a startled little cry.</p>
<p>He turned away to go to Rocket. A quick heavy
step sounded behind him. Knowles had sprung out
of the tent and was striding to overtake the retreating
man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Lafe,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton faced him with quiet resolution. His eyes
were dark with misery, but his once lax mouth was
strangely like Blake&#8217;s in its firm full lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing for me to do, Mr.
Knowles,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I am going away. Your
daughter will understand why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you going?&#8221; asked the cowman, his face
impassive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I traded with Miss&ndash;&ndash;Miss Knowles for Rocket.
Didn&#8217;t she ever tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t matter if she did. Rocket wasn&#8217;t her
hawss to trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, unless my pony is up here, I shall walk
down as far as the ranch,&#8221; said Ashton. He added
with bitter humiliation: &#8220;It&#8217;s well I have learned
about Rocket in time. I&#8217;ve done enough, without adding
horse thief to the list. I would have started at
once, but I could not leave until I had asked about Mr.
Blake. I wished to thank him for all that he has done
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that he&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; echoed Knowles. &#8220;If you want
to know, it was a mighty narrow squeak. But we
pulled him through. He&#8217;s awake now and says he&#8217;s
doing fine. He wants to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like very much to do as he wishes, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
Knowles, but I&ndash;&ndash;cannot bear to&ndash;&ndash;meet her. You
may realize that it is hard enough at best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sho!</i> If that&#8217;s all,&#8221; readily reassured the cowman,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Chuckie to go out and hide in the
bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I could not allow that, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I figure you&#8217;ve got to come anyhow. Can&#8217;t
let you go off without saying good-by to him and
Jenny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenny?&#8221; repeated Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the family now,&#8221; explained Knowles.
&#8220;Tom has been telling us how he&#8217;s got that irrigation
project all figured out in his head. He was saying
what he and Jenny had planned to do for us even
before Chuckie let out her secret. Come on and hear
the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear I must ask you to excuse me, Mr. Knowles.
I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; rejoined the cowman. &#8220;After
what you&#8217;ve done you can&#8217;t make me believe you&#8217;re
afraid of anything. You&#8217;ll come and face it out before
you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The misery in Ashton&#8217;s eyes deepened, and his lips
tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Since you put it that way, I shall do
as you wish, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he followed Knowles around to the door of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
the tent, Isobel, who was hastily braiding her loose
hair, drew back into the far corner and averted her
face from him. But Genevieve met him with a radiant
smile and motioned him to kneel down beside her
husband.</p>
<p>Blake, with one thick arm crooked about his sleeping
son, lay with his eyes closed. His big square face
was drawn and pallid, but there was a smile lurking in
the corners of his mouth. As Ashton knelt beside him
he looked up and lifted his free hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t take it&ndash;&ndash;down there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ashton flushed. &#8220;You know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take it now,&#8221; said Blake, with quiet confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. I am going away,&#8221; replied Ashton as he
held out his bandaged hand.</p>
<p>The big palm closed over it in a clasp as gentle as
it was strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Lafe. I&#8217;ve got hold of you now. I can&#8217;t
let you go. I need you in my business. We&#8217;re
organizing the Belle Mesa Irrigation and Development
Company.&ndash;&ndash;How do you like my new name for Dry
Mesa? Mr. Knowles puts in the reservoir site in
exchange for water on his other land, a tenth share in
the company, and a royalty of half the gold we placer
out of the reservoir bed. As Jenny is to put up all
the capital, she and I will take the lion&#8217;s share. That
will leave a tenth for you and a tenth for Belle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></p>
<p>Ashton sought to draw his hand away. &#8220;It is very
good of you, Mr. Blake. But I cannot accept&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can. You can&#8217;t help yourself. Besides,
I&#8217;ve an idea a man always does better by his work
when he has a stake in the undertaking. You&#8217;re to
be our Resident Engineer, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Resident Engineer?&#8221; repeated Ashton, paling and
flushing. &#8220;Mr. Blake, I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;It&#8217;s impossible
that you can mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it &#8216;Tom&#8217;! You&#8217;ll have to brush up on
mining engineering, too. There&#8217;s the bonanza.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Tom!&#8221; exclaimed Genevieve. &#8220;Tell
him about the gold mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to keep still about it till I had the apex
located,&#8221; he said. He looked full at Ashton. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s no one here that the secret will not be as safe
with as it is with me. Besides, it&#8217;s all in the family.
I found the vein a thousand feet up the chute of Dry
Fork Gulch. We will name it the Genevieve Lode.
There are six of us here, counting Tommy. Each of
us gets a sixth interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton was now pale. &#8220;Mr. Blake&ndash;&ndash;Tom, I cannot!
If I were fit to stay and work for you&ndash;&ndash;as an
axman&ndash;&ndash;anything!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Then your sixth will have
to go to Belle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine too, Tom,&#8221; hastily put in Knowles.</p>
<p>Blake looked down solemnly at his youthful heir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
&#8220;Hear that, Tommy? Guess we&#8217;ll have to pull out,
too, and make it half and half to the ladies." He
looked up at Ashton with a swift change from mock
to real gravity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to begin by installing a
turbine power-plant down here. Where will I find another
engineer with nerve enough to go down these
cliffs? I need you, Lafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, Tom.&#8221; Ashton drew his hand
from Blake&#8217;s wearied clasp, and rose.</p>
<p>Isobel slipped past him and stood with her arms outstretched
across the entrance of the tent. There was
a dimple in each of her blushing cheeks; her eyes were
radiant with tenderness and love.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t get away!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see how we&#8217;ve got you corralled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; confirmed Knowles. &#8220;I promised
her to rope and hogtie you if you made a break.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashton was gazing into the girl&#8217;s eyes, his own
shining with reverent adoration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isobel?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go up on the ridge and look out over our
mesa,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, dear,&#8221; interposed Genevieve.
&#8220;Lafayette, I wish to tell you that as soon as Tom and
I return to Chicago, we shall go to your father. I
feel certain that when he hears&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; begged Ashton. &#8220;You must wait.
Promise that you will wait. I have only begun to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
make a beginning. Wait until I see if I can&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
straightened and looked at Isobel, his head well up,
his eyes as resolute as his mouth. &#8220;Wait until I have
proved what I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Isobel. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to look at
our dry mesa that we are to reclaim and make into a
garden with the waste waters of the depths.&#8221;</p>
